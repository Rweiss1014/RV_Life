We will make a commission when you make a purchase at no cost to you, but it helps keep me on the road! Thanks for your support.The Florida Keys Blew My Mind (And Nearly Melted It)Okay, I'm just going to say it - the Florida Keys are the trip of a lifetime, but nobody tells you what it's really like to RV there for an extended period of time, ... in the summer.Just seven hours south of Orlando, but it feels like you've driven to another planet. I mean, when you're cruising down the Overseas Highway with the Atlantic Ocean on your left and the Gulf of Mexico on your right, pinching yourself because you’re finally really there. And when you finally get to Key West? You're only 90 miles from Cuba. Let that sink in.There are over 60 keys stretching 160 miles, and most of them you can only reach by boat. But the ones you can drive to? Pure magic.I was lucky enough to spend six whole weeks exploring every corner I could reach in my RV. Could you do it faster? Sure, a week would hit the highlights. But trust me, you'll want more time once you get there.When to Go (And Why I Chose Summer)I rolled into the Keys in late May, and let me tell you - it was HOT. Like, 94 degrees during the day and 84 at night hot. And it only got worse from there.But, summer is actually genius for RV travel if you can handle the heat. The crowds were so much smaller than the October-to-April madness. I could actually find campground spots without booking six months ahead, and the locals had time to chat instead of being overwhelmed by tourists.The reality check: Between 1 PM and 7 PM, you're basically trapped in air conditioning. I did all my exploring super early or late evening. But honestly? Those sunrise and sunset adventures were some of the best parts of my trip.RV Camping Costs (Prepare Your Wallet)Let's talk money because the sticker shock is real:State Parks: $16-$42 per night (reasonable!)Private RV Parks: $100-$300 per night (ouch!)My secret weapon: Thousand Trails membership got me into two different parks for just $20/night...that Thousand Trails membership literally paid for itself on this trip alone.Get the most recent information and the best price on Thousand Trails campingThe One Road Reality (This is Important!)Here's something that'll blowyourmind: there's literally ONE road in and out of the Keys. US Route 1, that's it. If there's construction, an accident, or bad weather, you're stuck. No joke.While I was there, they had construction at night with signs warning you couldn't pass through on certain days and times. I started planning my driving during daylight hours only - partly because of construction, but also because some of those bridges aren't well-lit, and honestly, they're a bit nerve-wracking at night.Oh, and get this - they actually have different speed limits for day and night! I'd never seen that before.Getting Your RV Ready (Learn From My Near-Disasters)Your RV better be ready for heat and wind. Those bridges, especially the Seven Mile Bridge, are almost always windy. I'm talking hold-onto-your-steering-wheel windy.My must-have list (wish I'd known this beforehand):Mosquito repellent (the bugs are no joke)Reef-friendly sunscreen - and buy more than you think you needA rock-solid AC systemReflectix for windows (game changer for keeping cool)Weather radio (storms pop up fast)Check out my suggested camping and outdoor items in my Amazon ShopWhere to Stay and What to Do in the Middle KeysI based myself at Fiesta Key in Long Key for three weeks, and it was perfect for exploring what I now call the real heart of the Keys - that stretch between Islamorada and Marathon.Marathon's got about 10,000 residents, and Islamorada has around 7,000 locals who've figured out the secret to living in paradise. What I loved about this area is it's not trying to be Key West or Key Largo - it has its own authentic, laid-back vibe.You can see thefull campground tour here.The Turtle Hospital- Life Changing Experience2396 Overseas Hwy, MarathonThis place isn't just some tourist trap - it's a working rehabilitation center that's been saving sea turtles for 35 years. They've treated over 2,000 turtles with a 70% release rate. These aren't just numbers; these are individual animals with names and personalities.The parking is great for RVs (there's even an overflow area), tours cost about $35, but you absolutely need reservations. This tour will change how you see ocean conservation forever. I'm not being dramatic - it really will.Sombrero Beach- Reality vs. ExpectationsSombrero Beach Rd, MarathonEveryone said this was one of the top beaches in the Florida Keys, and they weren't wrong. It's also one of the few actual white sand beaches here (most Keys beaches are rocky or have that imported sand).Pro Traveler Tip:Here's what the websites got wrong - parking isn't free! I paid $5 for my hour there. Though I'll give them credit, they have this cool system where you enter your phone number and get a text reminder when your time's almost up.The water was crystal clear, perfect for snorkeling, but there was quite a bit of seaweed from the previous week's storm. The staff was working hard to clear it, but just know that storms can affect beach conditions for days after.Crane Point- My Accidental Favorite Discovery5550 Overseas Hwy, MarathonThis wasn't even on my original must-see list. I just stumbled across this 63-acre nature preserve when I was poking around Marathon one day. The museum was closed for upgrades, but there were historic buildings and nature trails to explore.I wasn't even sure if I'd go back, but I ended up booking the 10 AM tour for the next day - and I'm so glad I did!The golf cart tour ($17.95) was perfect for a hot June day. A mile walk in that heat? No thank you. The 1.5-hour guided tour covers the whole preserve, and once you're in, you can stay all day. They even rent kayaks at the point.But here's the crazy part - they have these \"doctor fish\" that give pedicures! These little guys nibble away dead skin, and it's the most bizarre, ticklish, oddly relaxing thing I've ever experienced. Who knew you could get a spa treatment from fish in the middle of a nature preserve? And it's included in the tour price!You've also got historic homes like the Crane House and Adderley House, plus bird rehabilitation at the Florida Keys Wild Bird Center. I'll leave the rest for you to discover on your own.Herby's Bar and Chowder House2001 Overseas Hwy, MarathonThis is the definition of authentic Keys dining - exactly the kind of place locals hope tourists don't find. The portions are huge, the local beer selection is fantastic, and the vibe is perfectly Keys.We went all out: pork belly burnt ends, smoked fish dip, conch fritters, then the cheeseburger with pineapple fries and poutine fries. The food was incredible. And check out their t-shirts - they're really clever.Keys Fisheries3502 Gulfview Ave, MarathonThis isn't just a restaurant - it's a working seafood company that's been family-owned for over 70 years. The parking's a little tight for RVs, so I wouldn't recommend it. But the seafood was probably swimming in these waters yesterday.Their famous lobster reuben is absolutely ridiculous. I mean, who puts lobster on a reuben? Keys Fisheries does, and it works so well it's become their signature dish. There's even a guessing game - try to guess how many lobster reubens they sell each month and win a free one plus a t-shirt.What Surprised Me About the Middle KeysThe Middle Keys struck me as surprisingly developed and tourist-friendly. Cell service was excellent, grocery stores were easy to find, and those sunsets? Simply amazing. It felt accessible but still authentically Keys.Lower Keys: A Completely Different WorldAfter crossing the Seven Mile Bridge (what an experience in an RV with those crosswinds!), I entered a completely different world. Keep your eyes peeled for Fred the Tree on the southbound side as you cross - it's become a local landmark!I based myself at Sunshine Key RV Resort just north of Big Pine Key for another three weeks of sun and fun, and it was perfect for exploring everything south of the Seven Mile Bridge. The best part? I could walk just 50 feet to the Gulf and paddleboard to my heart's content.[For a video review of the campground, click here.]The Lower Keys felt completely different - more remote, wilder. Cell service was still excellent (actually the best I'd had in my entire time on the road!), but grocery stores and restaurants became scarcer with way less selection than the Middle Keys. It's quieter down here, with incredible natural beauty everywhere you look.What to Do in the Lower KeysBahia Honda State Park- Don't Miss This One!Mile Marker 37 on US 1While there are 11 state parks in the Florida Keys, this was the only one I visited. Some weren't on my travel route, and others were partially closed for restoration. But Bahia Honda is absolutely not to be missed!This place is perfect for everything - bicycling, hiking, swimming, birding, paddleboarding, kayaking, fishing, and snorkeling. You can camp here overnight or just spend the day exploring the walking trails up to the old Bahia Honda railroad bridge. Drive north on Silver Palm Road for gorgeous ocean scenery and another beach with parking.Cost: $4.50 entrance fee for single passenger vehicle, $8 for 2-8 people (unless you have an annual Florida State Park Pass - totally worth it if you're hitting multiple parks).No Name Key - End of the World VibesAccessible via concrete bridge off Route 1 near Big Pine KeyDrive about 3 miles into what feels like the middle of nowhere. Keep your eyes peeled for the tiny Key deer - you're right in the middle of their habitat! If you drive to the very end of the road, there's this peaceful spot where you genuinely feel like you've found the end of the world.Hungry or thirsty? Stop at the No Name Pub with their motto \"Nice place if you can find it.\" I found it, but it was closed when I stopped by.Bridge Walking at Little Duck Key - My Secret Sunset SpotMile Marker 37 on US 1There are so many pull offs where you can stop and walk out on the old Seven Mile Bridge. Originally, I planned to ride my scooter south from the north side to Pigeon Key, but I found this entrance on the south side that was just as good and way less crowded, with just a few fisherman casting off the bridge.I drove about 5 minutes north of my campground, across from the Veterans Memorial Park on Little Duck Key. I'm not sure if small scooters like mine were technically allowed, but nobody stopped me, and I rode out to the end of the bridge.The water was crystal clear - I could see huge Bahama Starfish and spotted Sea Hares (sea slugs). But here's the real secret: do this right before sunset. The uninterrupted view over the Gulf of Mexico creates one of the most beautiful sunsets you'll ever see.Horseshoe Beach - Hidden MagicMile Marker 35 on US 1This place was formed from an old quarry where coral was used to build the Overseas Highway, and it's absolutely magical. You'll find a boulder-lined shoreline bordered by mangroves, some picnic tables, a few fishermen, and perfect spots to park your chair and soak in the beauty. You can carefully walk out over the rock and coral to the end of the reef.This was another completely unexpected find and honestly one of the prettiest places I discovered in the entire Keys.Where to Eat in the Lower KeysHerby's Bar and Chowder House (Again!)2001 Overseas Hwy, MarathonThis place was so incredible that I went back again! Yes, it's technically north of the Seven Mile Bridge, but once you cross that bridge going south, restaurants get much harder to find.Castaway Waterfront Restaurant- The Lionfish Adventure1406 Gulfview Ave, MarathonAnother \"north of the bridge\" stop, but it had lionfish - and that was on my bucket list! This place was tricky to find, so definitely plug it into your GPS and trust it, even when you're convinced it's wrong.Plan to spend some money here, especially if you try the fantastically fresh sushi or want to tackle the lionfish or oysters.Pro Traveler Tips:Happy hour starts at 1 PM with amazing specialsIf you want the lionfish sushi roll, get there early! As a bonus, they fry up the head and tail for presentation. Don't be afraid to eat the fish cheeks - they're delicious!What I Loved Most About the Lower KeysThe Lower Keys had that Jimmy Buffett vibe I'd been searching for - laid back, friendly people, no rush to be anywhere at a certain time. Plus, I had the absolute best cell service of my entire road trip here.Key West: The Conch Republic MadnessNo Keys trip is complete without Key West, but when it's 97 degrees, you absolutely need a strategy! I used my RoadTrippers app to create an itinerary hitting everything I wanted to see before the heat became unbearable.I paid to park at the Butterfly and Nature Conservatory near my first stop (smart move for guaranteed parking).The Southernmost Point Buoy - 90 Miles from CubaCorner of South Street and Whitehead Street, Key WestThe line for this iconic photo op forms quickly and can stretch pretty far back, so I wanted to knock this out early in the morning.Pro Traveler Tip: If you don't want to wait in line, set up your shot from the side and snap it quickly when people change positions.Hemingway Houseand the Famous Six-Toed Cats907 Whitehead Street, Key WestHome to the legendary six (and seven!) toed cats - there were 58 cats total when I visited! The tour costs $19 for adults and lasts about 30 minutes, but you can stay as long as you want and explore on your own once you pay admission.Hemingway is one of my favorite authors, and visiting his house inspired me to dig out my anthology of Hemingway works and start reading again. There's something magical about being where he created those timeless stories.US Route 1 Mile Marker 0Corner of Fleming Street and Whitehead Street, Key WestThis is where Route 1 officially starts (or ends, depending on how you look at it). At 2,370 miles long, it stretches all the way from Key West to Fort Kent, Maine, along the Canadian border - making it the longest north-south road in the US.Fun fact: Another epic north-south road is Route 41, running about 2,000 miles from Miami toCopper Harbor, Michigan.My Walking Tour Strategy for Key WestUsing myRoadTrippers app, I mapped out a route that included the Green Parrot Bar, Captain Tony's, and Sloppy Joe's (where I bought a t-shirt to replace one I'd purchased 30 years ago!) plus Harry S. Truman's Little White House.These were mostly quick photo stops because honestly, after all that walking in 97-degree heat, I just wanted a cold drink and something to eat. It gives me plenty more to explore on my next Key West visit!Try it free for 7 days!Where I Ate in Key WestDJ's Clam Shack- Triple D Approved!629 Duval Street, Key WestHere's something funny - every restaurant I ate at in the Florida Keys turned out to be a Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives recommendation. I only realized this because each one proudly displayed their Triple D credentials!DJ's didn't disappoint with a cold IPA and a Maine lobster roll that helped cool me down. It wasn't fancy - just tables and chairs with lovely fans that I positioned myself right next to. But the food was absolutely delicious.I would have loved to try the Ipswich Fried Clam basket too. Definitely next time!What Surprised Me Most About Key WestOkay, confession time - I'm not a fan of Key Lime Pie. I know, I know, it's practically sacrilege in Key West, but it's true!What I absolutely loved was the amazing architecture - this incredible cross between Charleston and the Bahamas that creates such a unique visual experience.You can read about why Key West is also called the Conch Republichere.Solo RV Travel in the Florida KeysPhotography in the Keys became both my creative outlet and biggest challenge. Capturing those incredible water views often meant getting creative with tripod selfies or finding helpful strangers to take photos. The golden hour light here is absolutely magical.But the best part about traveling solo? I found myself striking up conversations everywhere - small diners, lighthouse tours, visitor centers. These chats often led to the best tips: hidden paddleboarding spots, the perfect sunset viewing locations, local events and stories that never make it into guidebooks.Apps That Saved My SanityRecreation.gov: For state park bookings and feesWeather apps: Weather changes fast here and affects all your water plansRoadTrippers:Perfect for finding those weird roadside gemsThe Bottom LineThe Florida Keys offer everything from turtle rescue centers to fish pedicures, from white sand beaches to lionfish sushi adventures, to the most amazing sunsets you'll ever witness. What makes RV travel here special isn't just the destinations - it's the freedom to discover them at your own pace.These aren't manufactured tourist experiences. These are real places run by real people who genuinely love sharing their piece of paradise with you. From the turtle hospital staff who know every animal's story to the locals at Herby's who made me feel like family (twice!), from the golf cart guide at Crane Point to the sushi chef proudly serving up lionfish at Castaways - the Keys are all about authentic connections.The diversity absolutely blew me away. In the Middle Keys, you've got developed tourist amenities alongside authentic local culture. Cross the Seven Mile Bridge, and suddenly you're in Jimmy Buffett territory - laid back, remote, with that end-of-the-world feeling at places like No Name Key and Horseshoe Beach. Then there's Key West, where Ernest Hemingway's cats still roam and you can stand at Mile Marker 0 knowing you're as far south as you can drive in America.The water colors alone - shifting between turquoise and deep blue on both the Atlantic and Gulf sides, filled with sea life from starfish, dolphin, tarpin, parrotfish, shrimp, several different types of crab and needlefish to sea slugs to the doctor fish giving pedicures - create a visual feast you won't find anywhere else.Six weeks wasn't too long. If anything, it made me realize how much more there is to discover. I'm already planning my return, but maybe during those cooler winter months when I won't melt walking around Key West!From the Middle Keys' perfect blend of accessibility and authenticity, to the Lower Keys' remote natural beauty and that unbeatable Jimmy Buffett vibe, to Key West's unique mix of literary history and Conch Republic quirkiness - this journey proved that some of America's most incredible experiences are waiting right in our own backyard.Want to follow more of my solo RV adventures?

      "My 6-Week Solo RV Adventure Through the Florida Keys: What I Wish I'd Known Before GoingWritten by Nancy Carter of Making My Own LaneThis article contains affiliate links. We will make a commission when you make a purchase at no cost to you, but it helps keep me on the road! Thanks for your support.The Florida Keys Blew My Mind (And Nearly Melted It)Okay, I'm just going to say it - the Florida Keys are the trip of a lifetime, but nobody tells you what it's really like to RV there for an extended period of time, ... in the summer.Just seven hours south of Orlando, but it feels like you've driven to another planet. I mean, when you're cruising down the Overseas Highway with the Atlantic Ocean on your left and the Gulf of Mexico on your right, pinching yourself because you’re finally really there. And when you finally get to Key West? You're only 90 miles from Cuba. Let that sink in.There are over 60 keys stretching 160 miles, and most of them you can only reach by boat. But the ones you can drive to? Pure magic.I was lucky enough to spend six whole weeks exploring every corner I could reach in my RV. Could you do it faster? Sure, a week would hit the highlights. But trust me, you'll want more time once you get there.When to Go (And Why I Chose Summer)I rolled into the Keys in late May, and let me tell you - it was HOT. Like, 94 degrees during the day and 84 at night hot. And it only got worse from there.But, summer is actually genius for RV travel if you can handle the heat. The crowds were so much smaller than the October-to-April madness. I could actually find campground spots without booking six months ahead, and the locals had time to chat instead of being overwhelmed by tourists.The reality check: Between 1 PM and 7 PM, you're basically trapped in air conditioning. I did all my exploring super early or late evening. But honestly? Those sunrise and sunset adventures were some of the best parts of my trip.RV Camping Costs (Prepare Your Wallet)Let's talk money because the sticker shock is real:State Parks: $16-$42 per night (reasonable!)Private RV Parks: $100-$300 per night (ouch!)My secret weapon: Thousand Trails membership got me into two different parks for just $20/night...that Thousand Trails membership literally paid for itself on this trip alone.Get the most recent information and the best price on Thousand Trails campingThe One Road Reality (This is Important!)Here's something that'll blowyourmind: there's literally ONE road in and out of the Keys. US Route 1, that's it. If there's construction, an accident, or bad weather, you're stuck. No joke.While I was there, they had construction at night with signs warning you couldn't pass through on certain days and times. I started planning my driving during daylight hours only - partly because of construction, but also because some of those bridges aren't well-lit, and honestly, they're a bit nerve-wracking at night.Oh, and get this - they actually have different speed limits for day and night! I'd never seen that before.Getting Your RV Ready (Learn From My Near-Disasters)Your RV better be ready for heat and wind. Those bridges, especially the Seven Mile Bridge, are almost always windy. I'm talking hold-onto-your-steering-wheel windy.My must-have list (wish I'd known this beforehand):Mosquito repellent (the bugs are no joke)Reef-friendly sunscreen - and buy more than you think you needA rock-solid AC systemReflectix for windows (game changer for keeping cool)Weather radio (storms pop up fast)Check out my suggested camping and outdoor items in my Amazon ShopWhere to Stay and What to Do in the Middle KeysI based myself at Fiesta Key in Long Key for three weeks, and it was perfect for exploring what I now call the real heart of the Keys - that stretch between Islamorada and Marathon.Marathon's got about 10,000 residents, and Islamorada has around 7,000 locals who've figured out the secret to living in paradise. What I loved about this area is it's not trying to be Key West or Key Largo - it has its own authentic, laid-back vibe.You can see thefull campground tour here.The Turtle Hospital- Life Changing Experience2396 Overseas Hwy, MarathonThis place isn't just some tourist trap - it's a working rehabilitation center that's been saving sea turtles for 35 years. They've treated over 2,000 turtles with a 70% release rate. These aren't just numbers; these are individual animals with names and personalities.The parking is great for RVs (there's even an overflow area), tours cost about $35, but you absolutely need reservations. This tour will change how you see ocean conservation forever. I'm not being dramatic - it really will.Sombrero Beach- Reality vs. ExpectationsSombrero Beach Rd, MarathonEveryone said this was one of the top beaches in the Florida Keys, and they weren't wrong. It's also one of the few actual white sand beaches here (most Keys beaches are rocky or have that imported sand).Pro Traveler Tip:Here's what the websites got wrong - parking isn't free! I paid $5 for my hour there. Though I'll give them credit, they have this cool system where you enter your phone number and get a text reminder when your time's almost up.The water was crystal clear, perfect for snorkeling, but there was quite a bit of seaweed from the previous week's storm. The staff was working hard to clear it, but just know that storms can affect beach conditions for days after.Crane Point- My Accidental Favorite Discovery5550 Overseas Hwy, MarathonThis wasn't even on my original must-see list. I just stumbled across this 63-acre nature preserve when I was poking around Marathon one day. The museum was closed for upgrades, but there were historic buildings and nature trails to explore.I wasn't even sure if I'd go back, but I ended up booking the 10 AM tour for the next day - and I'm so glad I did!The golf cart tour ($17.95) was perfect for a hot June day. A mile walk in that heat? No thank you. The 1.5-hour guided tour covers the whole preserve, and once you're in, you can stay all day. They even rent kayaks at the point.But here's the crazy part - they have these \"doctor fish\" that give pedicures! These little guys nibble away dead skin, and it's the most bizarre, ticklish, oddly relaxing thing I've ever experienced. Who knew you could get a spa treatment from fish in the middle of a nature preserve? And it's included in the tour price!You've also got historic homes like the Crane House and Adderley House, plus bird rehabilitation at the Florida Keys Wild Bird Center. I'll leave the rest for you to discover on your own.Herby's Bar and Chowder House2001 Overseas Hwy, MarathonThis is the definition of authentic Keys dining - exactly the kind of place locals hope tourists don't find. The portions are huge, the local beer selection is fantastic, and the vibe is perfectly Keys.We went all out: pork belly burnt ends, smoked fish dip, conch fritters, then the cheeseburger with pineapple fries and poutine fries. The food was incredible. And check out their t-shirts - they're really clever.Keys Fisheries3502 Gulfview Ave, MarathonThis isn't just a restaurant - it's a working seafood company that's been family-owned for over 70 years. The parking's a little tight for RVs, so I wouldn't recommend it. But the seafood was probably swimming in these waters yesterday.Their famous lobster reuben is absolutely ridiculous. I mean, who puts lobster on a reuben? Keys Fisheries does, and it works so well it's become their signature dish. There's even a guessing game - try to guess how many lobster reubens they sell each month and win a free one plus a t-shirt.What Surprised Me About the Middle KeysThe Middle Keys struck me as surprisingly developed and tourist-friendly. Cell service was excellent, grocery stores were easy to find, and those sunsets? Simply amazing. It felt accessible but still authentically Keys.Lower Keys: A Completely Different WorldAfter crossing the Seven Mile Bridge (what an experience in an RV with those crosswinds!), I entered a completely different world. Keep your eyes peeled for Fred the Tree on the southbound side as you cross - it's become a local landmark!I based myself at Sunshine Key RV Resort just north of Big Pine Key for another three weeks of sun and fun, and it was perfect for exploring everything south of the Seven Mile Bridge. The best part? I could walk just 50 feet to the Gulf and paddleboard to my heart's content.[For a video review of the campground, click here.]The Lower Keys felt completely different - more remote, wilder. Cell service was still excellent (actually the best I'd had in my entire time on the road!), but grocery stores and restaurants became scarcer with way less selection than the Middle Keys. It's quieter down here, with incredible natural beauty everywhere you look.What to Do in the Lower KeysBahia Honda State Park- Don't Miss This One!Mile Marker 37 on US 1While there are 11 state parks in the Florida Keys, this was the only one I visited. Some weren't on my travel route, and others were partially closed for restoration. But Bahia Honda is absolutely not to be missed!This place is perfect for everything - bicycling, hiking, swimming, birding, paddleboarding, kayaking, fishing, and snorkeling. You can camp here overnight or just spend the day exploring the walking trails up to the old Bahia Honda railroad bridge. Drive north on Silver Palm Road for gorgeous ocean scenery and another beach with parking.Cost: $4.50 entrance fee for single passenger vehicle, $8 for 2-8 people (unless you have an annual Florida State Park Pass - totally worth it if you're hitting multiple parks).No Name Key - End of the World VibesAccessible via concrete bridge off Route 1 near Big Pine KeyDrive about 3 miles into what feels like the middle of nowhere. Keep your eyes peeled for the tiny Key deer - you're right in the middle of their habitat! If you drive to the very end of the road, there's this peaceful spot where you genuinely feel like you've found the end of the world.Hungry or thirsty? Stop at the No Name Pub with their motto \"Nice place if you can find it.\" I found it, but it was closed when I stopped by.Bridge Walking at Little Duck Key - My Secret Sunset SpotMile Marker 37 on US 1There are so many pull offs where you can stop and walk out on the old Seven Mile Bridge. Originally, I planned to ride my scooter south from the north side to Pigeon Key, but I found this entrance on the south side that was just as good and way less crowded, with just a few fisherman casting off the bridge.I drove about 5 minutes north of my campground, across from the Veterans Memorial Park on Little Duck Key. I'm not sure if small scooters like mine were technically allowed, but nobody stopped me, and I rode out to the end of the bridge.The water was crystal clear - I could see huge Bahama Starfish and spotted Sea Hares (sea slugs). But here's the real secret: do this right before sunset. The uninterrupted view over the Gulf of Mexico creates one of the most beautiful sunsets you'll ever see.Horseshoe Beach - Hidden MagicMile Marker 35 on US 1This place was formed from an old quarry where coral was used to build the Overseas Highway, and it's absolutely magical. You'll find a boulder-lined shoreline bordered by mangroves, some picnic tables, a few fishermen, and perfect spots to park your chair and soak in the beauty. You can carefully walk out over the rock and coral to the end of the reef.This was another completely unexpected find and honestly one of the prettiest places I discovered in the entire Keys.Where to Eat in the Lower KeysHerby's Bar and Chowder House (Again!)2001 Overseas Hwy, MarathonThis place was so incredible that I went back again! Yes, it's technically north of the Seven Mile Bridge, but once you cross that bridge going south, restaurants get much harder to find.Castaway Waterfront Restaurant- The Lionfish Adventure1406 Gulfview Ave, MarathonAnother \"north of the bridge\" stop, but it had lionfish - and that was on my bucket list! This place was tricky to find, so definitely plug it into your GPS and trust it, even when you're convinced it's wrong.Plan to spend some money here, especially if you try the fantastically fresh sushi or want to tackle the lionfish or oysters.Pro Traveler Tips:Happy hour starts at 1 PM with amazing specialsIf you want the lionfish sushi roll, get there early! As a bonus, they fry up the head and tail for presentation. Don't be afraid to eat the fish cheeks - they're delicious!What I Loved Most About the Lower KeysThe Lower Keys had that Jimmy Buffett vibe I'd been searching for - laid back, friendly people, no rush to be anywhere at a certain time. Plus, I had the absolute best cell service of my entire road trip here.Key West: The Conch Republic MadnessNo Keys trip is complete without Key West, but when it's 97 degrees, you absolutely need a strategy! I used my RoadTrippers app to create an itinerary hitting everything I wanted to see before the heat became unbearable.I paid to park at the Butterfly and Nature Conservatory near my first stop (smart move for guaranteed parking).The Southernmost Point Buoy - 90 Miles from CubaCorner of South Street and Whitehead Street, Key WestThe line for this iconic photo op forms quickly and can stretch pretty far back, so I wanted to knock this out early in the morning.Pro Traveler Tip: If you don't want to wait in line, set up your shot from the side and snap it quickly when people change positions.Hemingway Houseand the Famous Six-Toed Cats907 Whitehead Street, Key WestHome to the legendary six (and seven!) toed cats - there were 58 cats total when I visited! The tour costs $19 for adults and lasts about 30 minutes, but you can stay as long as you want and explore on your own once you pay admission.Hemingway is one of my favorite authors, and visiting his house inspired me to dig out my anthology of Hemingway works and start reading again. There's something magical about being where he created those timeless stories.US Route 1 Mile Marker 0Corner of Fleming Street and Whitehead Street, Key WestThis is where Route 1 officially starts (or ends, depending on how you look at it).

And it's included in the tour price!You've also got historic homes like the Crane House and Adderley House, plus bird rehabilitation at the Florida Keys Wild Bird Center.

We will make a commission when you make a purchase at no cost to you, but it helps to keep me on the road. Thanks for your support!How and Why I Chose a Full-Time RV LifeLife is short, wouldn’t you agree? The lessons I learned during the craziness of 2020 and 2021 planted the seeds for change, and the events of 2022 pushed me over the edge.Taking time to reevaluate my job and lifestyle led me to understand that the opportunity I never believed was an option - slowing down, spending more time with family and friends, and traveling the US, really was a possibility.But in order to have this lifestyle, three things had to be in place.One. I needed an RV.I bought Daisy (my new-to-me 26.5 foot Class C motorhome) in December of 2022. Not to live in, but to travel locally with friends, and maybe to see the country when I could retire. Click here to read how I found Daisy, and why she is perfect for me.You can read more about how I chose Daisy here.Two. Paying for my lifestyle.Giving up the income I relied on to pay my mortgage and all the expenses that come with home ownership was not an option.But I hadn’t been happy for a long time, but I felt locked in. My life consisted of going to work so I could pay on a house that had grown too big, too empty, and full of stuff I no longer needed.So one day I quit my job.  Not necessarily what I expected to do when I woke up that morning, but certainly overdue.Three. Downsizing.Lots of soul-searching and finance-assessing showed me that living life in a motorhome and traveling more was a possibility,ifI sold my house, and everything in it.Not so sure about that idea, I did begin to purge my house of 20 years of stuff. Just in case, right? Three months later, I didn’t feel any closer to being able to move than when I started. Many trips to GoodWill, lots of contractor bags of garbage, so much shredding of old, once-important documents, and a couple of yard sales for those things I was able to part with, including boxes in my garage that hadn’t been opened since I put them there 20 years ago, when I moved into the house.I sold things on Ebay that I felt would be easy to sell and ship. But there was still so much stuff.Selling The HouseHowever, the urge to sell the house grew stronger, and 4 months after I quit my job, I listed my house on the market.The house sold in 3 days, still full of stuff that I now had one month to purge.If I thought the first three months of decluttering were tough, it was nothing compared to what the next 30 days would bring.I was motivated by the sale price, and agreed to an estate sale where whatever wasn't sold would be removed from the home. Perfect. In the end almost everything was donated to charity.I read books about downsizing, and other people’s experiences of selling everything and leaving their home of 20 years. All the emotions of watching things so important to you sell for pennies on the dollar, or not sell at all. But by this time I was too caught up in the whirlwind to stop, and one month later the house was empty and I was officially a nomad.Downsizing from a 3,000 square foot home with a pool on over half an acre and two cars to a 200-square foot home on wheels. No storage unit.It hurt to let so many of my worldly possessions go for nothing or next to nothing, but I did achieve my goal of getting rid of everything without taking on a storage unit or towing a trailer behind me full of stuff that I would never look at again.It all happened so fast that I hardly had time to think about what was going on. Probably for the best.Check out my favorite RV and outdoor gear ⬆️The Downsizing ExperienceAmazingly enough, looking back almost a year after I started this crazy experience, I have no regrets.I don’t miss the house, but I did shed many tears, especially that last week before the house closed. The memories of raising my daughters and all the happiness of having a house full of their friends was so strong.But the house had grown very quiet once they both moved out into their own places.I am a numbers and analytics geek, and possibly a bit frugal.It’s like I woke up one day to an empty home and thought to myself, “how am I ever going to keep this lifestyle up? How long can I do this for? What else would I do?”Then I quit my job, and everything figured itself out seemingly by itself. I still have a lot of questions and concerns, but I am trusting that God will show me those answers as I continue on in this journey.There has been lots of adjusting, even more purging, and mind-work. I have been pushed out of my comfort zone almost every day. And today I am happier and more free than I have ever been.Is it for everyone? No.Is it forever? Probably not.But for now, living on the road in an RV is a unique and sometimes exciting lifestyle that allows me to see the world in a way that most people never will. For me, the decision to embark on this journey was fueled by a desire for adventure, freedom, and a break from the monotony of everyday life.In this blog, I want to share with you living and traveling as a solo female RVer, recreating my life to a life I love living.You can’t escape life - the day-to-day grocery shopping, paying bills, taking the dogs for a walk kind of stuff. If you figure that out please let me know.The Benefits of RV LivingOne of the biggest benefits of RV living is the ability to travel and explore new places while still having the comforts of home, including the food I like to eat, the ability to choose from any of my outfits, the option of having my fur family with me, and familiarity of sleeping in my own bed every night, no matter where I am. I have become the best house guest!Eleven months after the unexpected start of this journey, a “mission statement” of sorts came to me.To create a sustainable, debt-free lifestyle while enjoying life, traveling, creating memories, spending time with the people I love, and making new friends along the way.So far, this lifestyle allows me to spend time with the people I love, meet new people, and experience the beauty of nature. Additionally, the flexibility of this lifestyle means that I can work from anywhere, allowing me to maintain an income while still enjoying the benefits of travel.While there are certainly challenges that come with RV living, such as maintenance and dealing with a small living space, the benefits far outweigh the negatives. It has allowed me to simplify my life and free my life from clutter, prioritize experiences over material possessions, and embrace a sense of adventure that was previously unattainable. Overall, my RV lifestyle journey is an incredibly rewarding experience that I wouldn't trade for anything.I hope you’ll come along for the ride as I continue Making My Own Lane.If you are a full-time RVer and have any tips or suggestions,leave a commenthere.To follow along with my travels, and learn about living in an RV full-time, please subscribe to the website.Thanks for reading!Click to share this post with others on Pinterest↓By submitting this form, you are consenting to receive emails from Making My Own Lane and Nancy Carter.

Probably not.But for now, living on the road in an RV is a unique and sometimes exciting lifestyle that allows me to see the world in a way that most people never will. For me, the decision to embark on this journey was fueled by a desire for adventure, freedom, and a break from the monotony of everyday life.In this blog, I want to share with you living and traveling as a solo female RVer, recreating my life to a life I love living.You can’t escape life - the day-to-day grocery shopping, paying bills, taking the dogs for a walk kind of stuff. If you figure that out please let me know.The Benefits of RV LivingOne of the biggest benefits of RV living is the ability to travel and explore new places while still having the comforts of home, including the food I like to eat, the ability to choose from any of my outfits, the option of having my fur family with me, and familiarity of sleeping in my own bed every night, no matter where I am. I have become the best house guest!Eleven months after the unexpected start of this journey, a “mission statement” of sorts came to me.To create a sustainable, debt-free lifestyle while enjoying life, traveling, creating memories, spending time with the people I love, and making new friends along the way.So far, this lifestyle allows me to spend time with the people I love, meet new people, and experience the beauty of nature. Additionally, the flexibility of this lifestyle means that I can work from anywhere, allowing me to maintain an income while still enjoying the benefits of travel.While there are certainly challenges that come with RV living, such as maintenance and dealing with a small living space, the benefits far outweigh the negatives. It has allowed me to simplify my life and free my life from clutter, prioritize experiences over material possessions, and embrace a sense of adventure that was previously unattainable. Overall, my RV lifestyle journey is an incredibly rewarding experience that I wouldn't trade for anything.I hope you’ll come along for the ride as I continue Making My Own Lane.If you are a full-time RVer and have any tips or suggestions,leave a commenthere.To follow along with my travels, and learn about living in an RV full-time, please subscribe to the website.Thanks for reading!",

We will make a commission when you make a purchase at no cost to you, but it helps keep me on the road! Thanks for your support.Why Mammoth Cave Became My Favorite DiscoveryOkay, I'll be honest – when I first heard about Mammoth Cave National Park, I thought it would be just another cave tour. Boy, was I wrong! After spending several days exploring this incredible place while camping in my 27-foot motorhome, I can tell you that Mammoth Cave completely exceeded my expectations and became one of my favorite stops in all my RV travels.Here's the thing that blew my mind: this place isn't just about caves (though they're absolutely incredible). Mammoth Cave surprised me in more ways than one.It's where I witnessed the most spectacular Northern Lights display of my entire life – and I'm talking about Kentucky, not Minnesota or Alaska! Plus, there's this whole fascinating history of \"Cave Wars\" that reads like something out of a movie.Located in south-central Kentucky, Mammoth Cave protects what's officially the world's longest cave system. We're talking over 400 miles of surveyed passages, with another 600 miles they think are still out there waiting to be discovered. Whether you're like me and love a good adventure, or you're more of a history buff, this UNESCO World Heritage Site has something that'll make you go \"wow.\"Facts About the World's Longest Cave SystemIt's Absolutely Massive (And Still Growing!)Here's what stopped me in my tracks: Mammoth Cave is the world's longest cave system with over 400 miles of mapped passages. Researchers think there might be another 600 miles down there that haven't even been explored yet! That means every time you hear about Mammoth Cave, it could literally be getting bigger as new sections are discovered.You're Walking on Top of It Right NowThis completely fascinated me – anywhere you're walking in Mammoth Cave National Park, you're probably standing directly above the cave system. The whole area is like Swiss cheese underneath! The limestone bedrock has been carved out by water over millions of years, creating this incredible underground maze.Deep Underground, But Not the Deepest PartDuring my cave tours, I found myself 400 feet below ground level. But here's the crazy part – I was still above the Green River, which flows through the lower levels of the cave system. That just shows you how massive this thing really is!Planning Your Cave Tours: What I Learned the Hard WayIs there an entrance fee for Mammoth National Park?There is no fee to enter the park; however, you do need to buy a ticket for each cave tour you would like to do.If you have yourSenior America the Beautiful pass(which you can purchase when you are 62), the tours are discounted 50%.The regular cave tour prices range from $12 to $79 for adults .Assume Longer Tours Are HarderI made this mistake initially – I thought the 4-hour tours would be the most challenging. Turns out, one of the 2-hour tours I did were actually more physically demanding than the 4-hour one! The park offers different tours for different fitness levels, but the time length doesn't always tell the whole story.There isa lotof stair-climbing and shimmying into rather tight spaces.You can bring your children on most tours; however baby \"backpacks\" are not allowed.Read the sign carefully in the staging area before you start the tour. Better yet, read it before you buy your tickets to determine if each individual tour is for you.Book Early or You'll Be DisappointedLet me save you some frustration – these tours book up FAST. I'm talking about needing to reserve well in advance, especially if you're visiting during peak season. Trust me, you don't want to drive all the way there only to find out everything's sold out.If you plan on using yourSenior Pass, you will get 50% of the price of each tour for yourself. However, these tickets must be purchased in person at the Mammoth Cave Park Visitor Center. If you book Mammoth Cave tours online, you will pay full-price, unlike when I booked my tours atVoyageurs National Park.Some tours are only offered at specific times of the year, as well.How Much Time Do I Need for the Tours at Mammoth Cave?During my four different tours (yes, I got a bit obsessed!), I explored some absolutely incredible areas:Frozen Niagara– This flowstone formation from 1923 literally looks like someone froze Niagara Falls. It's stunning.Fatman's Misery– Okay, this one's not for the claustrophobic! It's a tight crawl space that definitely tests your adventurous spirit.Bottomless Pit– The name says it all. Looking down into this thing gives you serious respect for the cave's depth.Snowball Dining Room– Fun fact: people actually used to eat meals down here until 2013! Can you imagine having lunch 400 feet underground?Bridal Altar– Couples could get married underground here. Talk about a unique wedding venue!And,no worries, because there are modern restrooms INthe caves!The Tour I Missed (And You Should Try to Catch)The Historic Tour, or Extended Historic Tour, includes an underground hospital that I didn't get to do, and I'm still kicking myself about it. Back in the early 1900s, they actually treated tuberculosis patients down in the caves. The history buff in me was so disappointed to miss this one, but I'm hoping be able to complete it when I go back this fall!The longest tour I did was 4 hours, and the shortest tour I did was 2 hours and they cover 1 to 3 miles of walking.The \"Cave Wars\" - Kentucky's Wildest BusinessWhen Caves Meant Serious MoneyHere's a story that sounds like it came straight out of a movie. Back in the early 1900s, owning a cave in this part of Kentucky was like hitting the lottery. Cave tours were huge business, and the competition between different cave owners got absolutely fierce. I'm talking about what they called the \"Cave Wars\" – and yes, it was as dramatic as it sounds.From Cutthroat Business to National TreasureThe rivalry got so intense that it actually helped push the federal government to step in and create Mammoth Cave National Park in 1941. Sometimes the best things come from the messiest situations, right? What started as a business battle ended up preserving one of America's most incredible natural wonders for all of us to enjoy.Northern Lights in Kentucky?!Dark Sky Park Status = Incredible StargazingFirst things first – Mammoth Cave is an International Dark Sky Park, which means the night sky here is absolutely phenomenal. Minimal light pollution makes it one of the best stargazing spots in the eastern U.S. But nothing prepared me for what I experienced one cold, clear October night.The Most Spectacular Aurora Display I've Ever SeenI had heard a rumor that there might be Northern Lights visible that night. Now, I'd seen aurora four times before in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, so I thought I knew what to expect. I was so wrong.I drove the 20 minutes from my campground to the visitor center area in complete darkness, and what I found there absolutely blew my mind. The aurora was visible for 180 degrees around the sky – I'm talking about the entire horizon! This wasn't just some faint green glow; these lights were dancing and pulsing in ways I'd never seen before.You canwatch my YouTube video about Mammoth Cave and the Northern Lights here.Three Hours of Pure MagicHere's what made this experience so incredible: the lights kept coming in waves. They'd appear for about 45 minutes, then seem to fade away. Just when I thought the show was over and I was heading back to my car, they'd come back even brighter than before! This happened three separate times over the course of about three hours.I wasn't alone out there either – I could hear other people in the darkness, all of us just standing there in awe. It was one of those moments where you realize you're witnessing something truly special.Regular Stargazing Programs TooEven if you don't get lucky with aurora activity, the park offers regular stargazing programs that take advantage of those incredibly dark skies. It's perfect for families or anyone who wants to learn more about what they're seeing up there.There's More Than Caves (Who Knew?)Surface Hiking That's Actually Pretty GreatI'll admit, I came for the caves and didn't expect much from the hiking. But the trail system here is actually really nice! There are options for different fitness levels, and you get to explore the landscape that sits on top of all those underground passages. Just keep in mind that trail conditions can change – during my visit, one of the hikes was cancelled for several days because a bridge was out.Free Walking Tours (Yes, Really Free!)The park offers free walking tours that explore the surface environment. These are great if you want to understand more about the ecosystem without going underground, or if you're traveling with someone who doesn't want to do the cave tours.Educational Programs Worth Your TimeThe educational programs here go way beyond just cave tours. They help you understand how the underground system connects to what you see on the surface, which honestly made the whole experience more meaningful for me.Everything was prominently displayed, making this park this easiest park, in my opinion, to see all the programs available and things to discover.And the Visitor Center had not only the best gift shops I have seen at a National Park, it had the best restaurants! The food was prepared for you with many delicious, healthy choices.I felt more like I was eating in a nice restaurant rather than a National Park Visitor Center.What to Expect When You VisitThe Thousand Trails SurpriseHere's something that caught me completely off guard – there's actually a Thousand Trails campground right inside the national park, Diamond Caverns Campground! I never would have expected that. It's super convenient, though you'll need to drive about 20 minutes to get to the visitor center where all the cave tours start.There are also three other campgrounds within the park. You can check them out atrecreation.govGet out and camp! Let me help you get the best deal on a Thousand Trails Camping Pass or Membership.Learn moreWeather Can Be a Wild CardKentucky weather is... well, let's just say it keeps things interesting. During my visit, I had planned to sit outside and enjoy the day, but it was cold and rainy, so I ended up with the heater running in my RV. Cave tours generally run year-round regardless of weather (it's always 54°F down there!), but surface activities can definitely be affected.Watch Out for Those Narrow BridgesIf you're traveling in an RV like I am, heads up – some of the bridges in the park are pretty narrow. I had a moment where I thought I might be stuck, but it worked out. Just be prepared for some tight spots, especially if you're in a larger rig.The Bat SituationLet's talk about the bats, because everyone asks. You'll see them during tours, but they're not huge colonies like you might expect. Most of the bats in Mammoth Cave are pretty small – about the size of your thunb. They're actually kind of cute in their own way.During my eight hours in the caves, I only saw one bat. And only because the guide pointed it out to us. And it was the size of your fist - a little larger than a thumb!Is There RV Parking Available.The visitor has a huge parking lot that can accommodate many RVs, even larger rigs!ArePets Allowed on the Trails?While pets are allowed on the surface trails in the park, they are not permitted in caves or park buildings, and they must be leashed at all times on a six-foot or less leash.Where Can You Stay for Your Visit?The Thousand Trails SurpriseI stayed at Diamond Caverns Campground, a Thousand Trails campground right inside the national park! I never would have expected that. It's super convenient, about a 20-minute drive from the Mammoth Cave Visitor Center, where all the cave tours start.There are also three other campgrounds within the park. You can check them out atrecreation.govHistorical SignificanceIndigenous HistoryLong before European settlement, Native American peoples were aware of and used the cave system. Archaeological evidence suggests that indigenous peoples explored and utilized portions of the cave for thousands of years, leaving behind artifacts and evidence of their presence.Commercial Cave PeriodThe commercial development of Mammoth Cave began in the early 1800s, leading to the competitive period known as the Cave Wars. Different operators competed fiercely for tourist dollars, creating elaborate marketing campaigns and developing new sections of the cave to attract visitors.Conservation MovementThe establishment of Mammoth Cave National Park in 1941 represented a significant victory for the conservation movement. The federal government's decision to protect this unique natural resource ensured that future generations would have access to the world's longest cave system.Essential Tips and RecommendationsBest Times to VisitMammoth Cave National Park can be visited year-round, but different seasons offer different advantages. Spring and fall typically provide the most comfortable weather for both cave tours and surface activities. Summer can be busy but offers the longest days for exploring. Winter visits can be particularly rewarding for those interested in stargazing, as the longer nights provide more opportunities for astronomical observation.Bring the proper gear for your hiking toursCave tours require specific preparation:Comfortable walking shoes with good gripLayered clothing (caves maintain constant temperatures around 54°F)Water and snacks for longer toursCamera (where permitted)Flashlight or headlamp for certain tours, although the tours I was on provided these for the tours that explored the darkest areas of the cave.You can find my favorite hiking sandals and other outdoor adventures in the Amazon ShopPhysical PreparationDifferent cave tours have varying physical requirements. While most of the paths are paved and very easy to walk on, it does involve significant walking, crawling, or even  climbing. Visitors should honestly assess their fitness level and choose tours accordingly. The park staff can provide detailed information about the physical demands of each tour option, and the fitness level expectations listed on each of the tour descriptions is very accurate.Advance PlanningDue to the popularity of cave tours, advance reservations are strongly recommended, especially during peak seasons. The park's website provides detailed information about tour availability and booking procedures.Conservation and PreservationProtecting the Cave EnvironmentMammoth Cave's delicate ecosystem requires careful protection. Visitors play a crucial role in conservation by following all park guidelines, staying on designated paths, and avoiding touching cave formations. The oils from human skin can damage delicate limestone formations and disrupt the cave's natural processes.Research and Scientific StudyOngoing research at Mammoth Cave continues to reveal new information about the cave system's geology, ecology, and extent. Scientists regularly discover new passages and study the unique life forms that have adapted to the cave environment.There have also been discoveries of over 40 different species of ancient sharks, including several new genus and species of sharks not identified before.Why Mammoth Cave Deserves to be on Your Travel ListMammoth Cave National Park offers a truly unique combination of natural wonder, historical significance, and recreational opportunity.

We will make a commission when you make a purchase at no cost to you, but it helps keep me on the road! Thanks for your support.Why Mammoth Cave Became My Favorite DiscoveryOkay, I'll be honest – when I first heard about Mammoth Cave National Park, I thought it would be just another cave tour. Boy, was I wrong! After spending several days exploring this incredible place while camping in my 27-foot motorhome, I can tell you that Mammoth Cave completely exceeded my expectations and became one of my favorite stops in all my RV travels.Here's the thing that blew my mind: this place isn't just about caves (though they're absolutely incredible). Mammoth Cave surprised me in more ways than one.It's where I witnessed the most spectacular Northern Lights display of my entire life – and I'm talking about Kentucky, not Minnesota or Alaska! Plus, there's this whole fascinating history of \"Cave Wars\" that reads like something out of a movie.Located in south-central Kentucky, Mammoth Cave protects what's officially the world's longest cave system. We're talking over 400 miles of surveyed passages, with another 600 miles they think are still out there waiting to be discovered. Whether you're like me and love a good adventure, or you're more of a history buff, this UNESCO World Heritage Site has something that'll make you go \"wow.\"Facts About the World's Longest Cave SystemIt's Absolutely Massive (And Still Growing!)Here's what stopped me in my tracks: Mammoth Cave is the world's longest cave system with over 400 miles of mapped passages. Researchers think there might be another 600 miles down there that haven't even been explored yet! That means every time you hear about Mammoth Cave, it could literally be getting bigger as new sections are discovered.You're Walking on Top of It Right NowThis completely fascinated me – anywhere you're walking in Mammoth Cave National Park, you're probably standing directly above the cave system. The whole area is like Swiss cheese underneath! The limestone bedrock has been carved out by water over millions of years, creating this incredible underground maze.Deep Underground, But Not the Deepest PartDuring my cave tours, I found myself 400 feet below ground level. But here's the crazy part – I was still above the Green River, which flows through the lower levels of the cave system.

Researchers think there might be another 600 miles down there that haven't even been explored yet! That means every time you hear about Mammoth Cave, it could literally be getting bigger as new sections are discovered.You're Walking on Top of It Right NowThis completely fascinated me – anywhere you're walking in Mammoth Cave National Park, you're probably standing directly above the cave system. The whole area is like Swiss cheese underneath! The limestone bedrock has been carved out by water over millions of years, creating this incredible underground maze.Deep Underground, But Not the Deepest PartDuring my cave tours, I found myself 400 feet below ground level. But here's the crazy part – I was still above the Green River, which flows through the lower levels of the cave system. That just shows you how massive this thing really is!",

      "Northern Lights in Kentucky?!Dark Sky Park Status = Incredible StargazingFirst things first – Mammoth Cave is an International Dark Sky Park, which means the night sky here is absolutely phenomenal. Minimal light pollution makes it one of the best stargazing spots in the eastern U.S. But nothing prepared me for what I experienced one cold, clear October night.The Most Spectacular Aurora Display I've Ever SeenI had heard a rumor that there might be Northern Lights visible that night. Now, I'd seen aurora four times before in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, so I thought I knew what to expect. I was so wrong.I drove the 20 minutes from my campground to the visitor center area in complete darkness, and what I found there absolutely blew my mind. The aurora was visible for 180 degrees around the sky – I'm talking about the entire horizon! This wasn't just some faint green glow; these lights were dancing and pulsing in ways I'd never seen before.You canwatch my YouTube video about Mammoth Cave and the Northern Lights here.Three Hours of Pure MagicHere's what made this experience so incredible: the lights kept coming in waves. They'd appear for about 45 minutes, then seem to fade away. Just when I thought the show was over and I was heading back to my car, they'd come back even brighter than before! This happened three separate times over the course of about three hours.I wasn't alone out there either – I could hear other people in the darkness, all of us just standing there in awe. It was one of those moments where you realize you're witnessing something truly special.Regular Stargazing Programs TooEven if you don't get lucky with aurora activity, the park offers regular stargazing programs that take advantage of those incredibly dark skies. It's perfect for families or anyone who wants to learn more about what they're seeing up there.",

Archaeological evidence suggests that indigenous peoples explored and utilized portions of the cave for thousands of years, leaving behind artifacts and evidence of their presence.Commercial Cave PeriodThe commercial development of Mammoth Cave began in the early 1800s, leading to the competitive period known as the Cave Wars. Different operators competed fiercely for tourist dollars, creating elaborate marketing campaigns and developing new sections of the cave to attract visitors.Conservation MovementThe establishment of Mammoth Cave National Park in 1941 represented a significant victory for the conservation movement.

      "Skip to contentMaking My Own LaneHomeYou TubeRV Budget WorksheetThousand TrailsGift IdeasRV Living ResourcesBlogWork With MeContact meContact meMy Bourbon Trail Adventure: A Long Weekend in Kentuckywritten by Nancy Carter of Making My Own LaneThis post may contain affiliate links, which means we may receive a commission, at no cost to you, if you make a purchase through a link.Please see our full disclosurefor more information.I thought I knew bourbon. I've been enjoying a glass of Kentucky's finest for years, appreciating the smooth warmth and complex flavors. But let me tell you – tasting bourbon and understanding bourbon are two completely different things.My recent four-day exploration of Kentucky's Bourbon Trail transformed me from a casual bourbon drinker into someone who truly appreciates the artistry, science, and heritage behind every bottle. I visited four distilleries, each offering a unique perspective on bourbon production.Where I Stayed For Bourbon Trail ExplorationBefore diving into the bourbon trail, let me share how I approached this adventure from an RV perspective. I split my Kentucky stay between two strategic base camps, each chosen to maximize my access to different clusters of distilleries while minimizing drive time and stress.My first stop was the Thousand Trails Diamond Caverns campground near Cave City. Staying here is free with my Thousand Trails membership, and I enjoyed comfortable camping with full hookups. This location gave me easy access to several distilleries in the southern part of the bourbon trail region, as well as Mammoth Cave National Park.Later, I moved north toKentucky Horse Park State Park Campgroundnear Lexington, paying $45 per night with my AAA discount. This put me right in the heart of bourbon country, surrounded by rolling hills, pristine horse farms, and multiple distilleries within a 30-minute drive. The campground itself was excellent – two double horseshoe-shaped loops, a well-stocked camp store with local products, and even tennis courts. It was the perfect home base for exploring the Lexington-area distilleries.For anyone planning their own bourbon trail RV adventure, strategic campground placement is so important. The bourbon trail distilleries are spread across roughly 100 miles, primarily concentrated in the areas around Louisville, Bardstown, and Lexington. Planning your base camps to minimize backtracking will make your experience much more enjoyable and leave you more energy for appreciating the bourbon rather than fighting fatigue from long drives.Get the most recent information and the best price on Thousand Trails campingUnderstandingthe Kentucky Bourbon TrailThe official Kentucky Bourbon Trail includes approximately 38 distilleries, though the number can vary as new distilleries join or offerings change. There's also the Kentucky Bourbon Trail Craft Tour, which features smaller, craft distilleries. Combined, there are around 57-60 distilleries you could potentially visit across the region.Kentucky produces roughly 95% of the world's bourbon, and there are more barrels of bourbon aging in Kentucky right now than there are people living in the state. Millions and millions of barrels, quietly resting in warehouses across this beautiful state, developing the flavors that will eventually be enjoyed around the world.But why Kentucky? What makes this state so perfect for bourbon production? The answer lies in several factors: the limestone-filtered water that's naturally iron-free and mineral-rich, the climate with its hot summers and cold winters that push bourbon in and out of the barrel wood, and centuries of accumulated knowledge and tradition. You can make bourbon anywhere in the United States legally, but you can't replicate the Kentucky natural environment.I knew I couldn't visit all the distilleries in one trip, so I carefully selected four that would give me a well-rounded introduction: a small craft distillery with unique connections, a major heritage distillery with deep history, a premium distillery known for its visitor experience, and another craft operation offering intimate tastings. Each one taught me something different about bourbon production and Kentucky culture.Stop One:Balance Distilling Co.My bourbon education began atBalance Distilling Co.. Balance is a privately-owned craft distillery, the kind of operation where you can still feel the passion and personal investment in every aspect of production.Walking into Balance Distillery felt like discovering a hidden place tucked into the hills of Kentucky. This isn't a massive commercial operation churning out millions of bottles annually – this is a family business where craftsmanship takes precedence over volume.My tour started with those beautiful copper pot stills, and my guide explained why copper is essential to quality spirits production. Copper naturally removes sulfur compounds during distillation, which would otherwise create unpleasant flavors in the final product. That's why virtually every quality distillery, whether making bourbon, scotch, or any other spirit, uses copper stills or copper elements in their distillation process. The stills at Balance aren't just functional equipment – they're works of art, gleaming and well-maintained, testament to the care this operation takes with every aspect of production.What really fascinated me was learning that Balance produces not just bourbon, but also rum, gin, and moonshine. I was told their goal is to keep the recipes original to the historical recipes  of the Prohibition.Each spirit requires its own unique techniques, its own carefully calibrated processes. The bourbon-making process alone involves countless variables: the specific grain recipe, the particular strain of yeast, the char level on the oak barrels, the location where those barrels age in the warehouse, even the weather patterns during the aging period. Every single decision impacts the final flavor profile.The guide walked me through the entire bourbon production process, from grain to glass.Here's what makes Balance truly special and relevant to my Kentucky adventure: they hold the trademark for Mammoth Cave Bourbon. After spending time exploring that magnificent cave system, discovering that there's a bourbon named after it felt like finding the perfect Kentucky connection.And here's a fun fact that bourbon lovers will appreciate – Balance Distillery's Mammoth Cave Bourbon is sold in the gift shop at Mammoth Cave National Park, making it one of only two National Parks in the entire United States that sell local alcohol in their gift shops.The tasting at Balance was my first real lesson in bourbon appreciation. My guide taught me the proper technique: first, observe the color (which tells you about barrel char and aging time). Then, nose the bourbon – but never stick your nose directly in the glass, as the alcohol will overpower everything. Instead, hold the glass a few inches away and gently waft the aroma toward you. Take a small sip and let it coat your entire mouth before swallowing, then pay attention to the finish – the flavors that linger after you swallow.Each bourbon Balance produces has a distinct character. Their standard bourbon showcases classic notes of caramel and vanilla with a gentle spice. Their higher-rye expression brings more pepper and cinnamon to the forefront. Learning to identify these differences was like learning a new language – one I was eager to become fluent in.I left Balance with not just bottles of bourbon, but with a foundation of knowledge that would inform every subsequent distillery visit. Understanding the basics of bourbon production at a smaller, craft operation made it easier to appreciate the scale and complexity of the larger distilleries I'd visit next.Stop Two:Buffalo Trace DistilleryIf Balance Distillery was bourbon school's introductory course,Buffalo Tracewas the advanced seminar. This is one ofKentucky's most famous distilleries, producing brands like Buffalo Trace, Eagle Rare, Blanton's, Pappy Van Winkle, and many others.It's a National Historic Landmark with a history stretching back to 1773 - making it one of the oldest continuously operating distilleries in the United States.Getting there in my RV was its own adventure. Buffalo Trace's RV parking lot required some careful maneuvering, especially since there was a festival happening that day and the parking area was packed. I'm traveling with a 41-foot total rig (motorhome plus towed car), and finding a spot I could both fit into and eventually get out of took some concentration and patience.I was surprised how full the parking lot was, and I had to leave the area, cross the street, and come back in again so I could approach the one remaining RV parking space and park both my RV and my Jeep in straight.Here's where Buffalo Trace demonstrated the kind of hospitality that makes Kentucky special: they have a trolley service that picks up visitors from the RV lot and brings them to the main visitor center. Because I was running close to my scheduled tour time, they drove me over separately and escorted me right to the front of a very long line.VIP treatment! For anyone planning to visit Buffalo Trace in an RV, know that they genuinely want to accommodate you – just allow extra time for parking and transportation.I had booked about a week in advance for something called the Flood Tour, and getting into this tour was like winning the bourbon lottery. They only offered it six times, and I managed to secure a spot on the very last one. The tour was led by the general manager himself, which meant we were getting information and stories from someone with intimate knowledge of every aspect of the operation.The Flood Tour focused on the devastating 1937 flood that nearly destroyed the distillery (then called George T. Stagg Distillery). The Ohio River crested at over 47.46 feet, and water reached the second floor of many distillery buildings. Our guide showed us photographs of workers in boats rowing between buildings, of barrels floating in warehouses, of the massive cleanup and rebuilding effort that followed.Buffalo Trace is currently still cleaning up from the most recent, and flood of 2025, where the water from the Kentucky River crested at 48.27 feet . Although many of the flood effects could only be noticed if pointed out by someone who actually participated in the cleanup.Standing in the very buildings that have survived flooding, hearing stories about how workers risked their lives to save precious barrels and protect the distillery's most valuable assets through several floods, brought history to life in a way that reading about it never could. The resilience and determination it took to rebuild and continue making bourbon through that disaster was inspiring. Buffalo Trace didn't just survive – they emerged stronger, with new systems in place to protect against future flooding.But the tour wasn't just about history. We walked through active production areas, seeing the fermentation tanks bubbling with working mash, smelling the sweet, yeasty aroma that fills the air around fermenting bourbon. We visited the still house, where massive copper column stills work continuously, converting fermented mash into new-make spirit (what bourbon is called before it goes into barrels).The aroma of the mash throughout the distillery was intoxicating. I suggested to the general manager that they should somehow make a candle scent to duplicate it.Then came the barrel warehouses, and this is where you really understand the scale of bourbon production. These aren't small storage rooms – they're massive multi-story buildings, each holding tens of thousands of barrels. Our guide explained that Buffalo Trace produces about 400-500 barrels per day, every single day. Those barrels will age for anywhere from four to 23+ years, depending on the brand and expression.The location of barrels within these warehouses matters enormously. Top-floor barrels experience dramatic temperature swings – scorching hot in summer, freezing in winter. This temperature variation pushes the bourbon deep into the barrel wood in summer, extracting color and flavor, then pulls it back out in winter, bringing those wood-derived compounds into the bourbon. Bottom-floor barrels age more slowly and evenly, with less temperature variation.This is why single-barrel bourbons from the same distillery, even aged for the same amount of time, can taste dramatically different. One barrel might have spent its life on the top floor of a hot warehouse, developing intense flavors. Another might have aged on a cool bottom floor, resulting in a gentler profile. The master distiller's job is to understand these differences and either blend barrels to achieve consistency (for standard expressions) or select exceptional single barrels that showcase unique characteristics.The tasting at the end of the Flood Tour included several spirits we couldn't have tried anywhere else – limited releases, barrel-proof versions, and experimental bourbons that never make it to general distribution. Each pour came with stories about the specific barrels selected, the aging conditions, and the flavor profile the distillers were trying to achieve.Our guide also shared an invaluable tip: look for Buffalo Trace's daily specials. They rotate special bottle releases and discounts regularly, and if you're lucky, you might find something rare or get a significant discount on bottles that would cost considerably more elsewhere. I took advantage of a special that day and came home with some bourbon I probably never would have found at my local liquor store.Stop Three:Woodford ReserveThe next day, I headed to another National Landmark property,Woodford Reserve, and I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised.After the crowds at Buffalo Trace, I was expecting long lines and chaos. Instead, I walking right in with virtually no wait.Sometimes timing is everything, and my morning arrival on Monday hit a perfect lull between tours.I had booked what they call a \"senses tour,\" and this experience revolutionized my understanding of bourbon appreciation. Instead of just sipping different bourbons and trying to describe what we tasted, they paired each whiskey with specific foods that brought out completely different flavor notes. It was a revelation.Our guide started by explaining that bourbon, like wine, has an incredibly complex flavor profile with hundreds of distinct compounds. But unlike wine, where you can often taste the grape variety and growing region, bourbon's flavors come primarily from three sources: the grain (contributing sweet, grainy, or spicy notes), the yeast (adding fruity or floral elements), and the barrel (providing vanilla, caramel, oak, and spice from the charred wood).Then came the practical demonstration. First, we tasted Woodford Reserve's classic bourbon neat – no food, no ice, just the bourbon itself. I could identify vanilla, caramel, maybe some spice on the finish. Nice, but relatively straightforward.Then we tasted the same bourbon with a piece of dark chocolate. Suddenly, the vanilla and caramel notes exploded. The chocolate somehow brought those flavors forward, making them more pronounced and distinct. It was like the bourbon had transformed into something completely different.Next, we paired that same bourbon with a salted pretzel. Boom – another complete transformation. Now the spice notes came forward. The salt emphasized the char from the barrel and the rye spice in the mash bill. The caramel and vanilla receded into the background, letting the bolder flavors shine.We continued through several more pairings – bourbon with aged cheddar (highlighting savory notes), bourbon with dried cherry (emphasizing fruit notes), bourbon with toasted pecans (bringing out nuttiness I hadn't noticed before). Each combination revealed different aspects of the same bourbon.The lesson was clear: bourbon isn't one-dimensional. A good bourbon has enough complexity that different foods can highlight different aspects of its flavor profile. Our guide explained that this is why bourbon works so beautifully with food, and why thoughtful pairings can enhance both the food and the bourbon.He recommended specific pairings for different bourbon styles: wheated bourbons (like Maker's Mark), which are softer and sweeter, pair beautifully with desserts and mild cheeses. High-rye bourbons (like Woodford Reserve or Four Roses), which are spicier and bolder, work better with savory dishes, grilled meats, or strong cheeses. Barrel-proof bourbons can stand up to intensely flavored foods that would overwhelm lower-proof spirits.We toured the production facilities, seeing the small fermentation tanks (Woodford uses smaller tanks than most large distilleries, believing it allows for better temperature control and more consistent fermentation), the gleaming copper stills, and the bottling line where finished bourbon is carefully filtered, proofed down to bottling strength, and packaged.The property itself is stunning – a National Historic Landmark with buildings dating back to the 1800s, surrounded by rolling Kentucky hills. A natural spring on the property provides their water source, and our guide explained that water quality is crucial to bourbon production. Kentucky's limestone-filtered water naturally removes iron (which would create off-flavors) and adds minerals that yeast loves. It's one of the geological advantages that makes Kentucky so perfect for bourbon production.Woodford Reserve also taught me that both they and Buffalo Trace offer multiple different tour types, each with different themes and different whiskeys to sample. The offerings rotate, so if you returned on a different day or in a different season, you could have a completely different experience. That's definitely something I'm keeping in mind for future visits – you could visit the same distillery multiple times and always learn something new.Lunch Break atRicardo's Grill and PubWith a couple hours between my Woodford Reserve tour and my next distillery visit, I decided to treat myself to lunch atRicardo'sin Versailles. Yes, Versailles – but it's pronounced \"Ver-SAILS\" in Kentucky, not like the palace in France. I learned that the hard way when asking for directions!Ricardo's is housed in an old train station, and walking in felt like stepping back to a different era. The building has retained so much of its original character – soaring ceilings, exposed brick walls, old wooden floors worn smooth by decades of foot traffic, and massive windows overlooking what used to be the railway platform where passengers waited for trains.I ordered the catfish – and it was exceptional. Sitting there with my lunch and a glass of sweet tea, watching life go by in this small Kentucky town, I felt completely content.This is one of the unexpected joys of solo travel – these quiet moments where you can just be present, soaking in the atmosphere of a place without having to coordinate with anyone else or maintain conversation. The server chatted with me about the bourbon trail, recommended some back roads for scenic driving, and treated me like a welcomed guest rather than just another tourist passing through.Kentucky hospitality is real. It's not just a marketing slogan. Throughout my entire bourbon trail experience, from distillery staff to restaurant servers to fellow travelers I met along the way, everyone embodied a genuine warmth and eagerness to share what makes their state special.Bourbon Country Roads and SceneryI want to take a moment to talk about the drives between distilleries, because the journey is just as much a part of the bourbon trail experience as the destinations themselves.Kentucky bourbon country is absolutely beautiful. The landscape consists of gentle, rolling hills covered in that famous Kentucky bluegrass (which is actually green, despite the name). White board fences mark property boundaries, creating picturesque patterns across the hillsides. Thoroughbred horses graze peacefully in pristine pastures. Old tobacco barns, weathering gracefully, dot the countryside as reminders of Kentucky's agricultural heritage.On the road to my final distillery stop, I passed several massive brick warehouses owned by Jim Beam. These aren't just storage buildings – they're where millions of gallons of bourbon are quietly aging right now, developing the flavors that will eventually be enjoyed around the world. Seeing those warehouses from the road, knowing what's inside, made me appreciate the scale of Kentucky's bourbon industry. This isn't just a tourist attraction – it's a living, working industry that's central to Kentucky's economy and identity.There's something meditative about driving through this landscape. With the windows down on a beautiful day, you can smell the grass, occasionally catch the sweet aroma from nearby distilleries, and just soak in the peaceful beauty of rural Kentucky. I found myself taking back roads whenever possible, preferring the scenic route over faster highways.For RV travelers, these back roads are generally narrow with many low-lying branches, one-lane bridges and lots of twists and turns.  Both Buffalo Trace and Woodford have places large enough for RVs to park, but Buffalo Trace was the only one of a main road.  I would not have felt comfortable driving my rig through bourbon country, except on the main roads. Have my Jeep with me made the tour a lot more enjoyable.You can also rent a tour guide and driver to take you around, avoiding driving altogether!Stop Four:Glenns Creek DistillingMy final distillery tour was atGlenns Creek, a smaller, privately-owned operation that had taken over the Old Crow distillery buildings some years back.After the larger, more polished operations at Buffalo Trace and Woodford Reserve, Glenns Creek felt refreshingly intimate and unvarnished.This wasn't a huge tour group following a scripted presentation – it was just a small group of genuine bourbon enthusiasts gathering around a table with one of Glenns Creek's distillers for a tasting and open-ended question-and-answer session. It felt less like a tour and more like sitting down with a knowledgeable friend who happens to make exceptional bourbon.What struck me immediately was how different Glenns Creek bourbons tasted compared to the others I'd sampled. These expressions were sharper, spicier, with more bite and character. They weren't smooth in the traditional sense – they were bold and unapologetic.The distiller explained their philosophy: they're not trying to make bourbon that tastes like Buffalo Trace or Woodford Reserve or any other established brand. They're creating something distinctively their own, and they're not afraid to push boundaries.Glenns Creek uses a higher rye content in their mash bill, which gives their bourbon that distinctive spicy, peppery profile. They also use a heavier char on their barrels – a char level that many larger distilleries would consider too aggressive. And they intentionally age their whiskey in parts of their warehouses where temperature fluctuations are more dramatic, accelerating the interaction between bourbon and barrel wood.The result is bourbon that demands attention. It's not background music – it's a bold statement. Some people love it immediately. Others need to adjust their palate. But nobody tastes Glenns Creek bourbon and forgets it.During our discussion, the distiller opened up about the challenges smaller distilleries face. They can't achieve the economies of scale that the big names do. They can't get the same distribution. They can't spend millions on marketing. But they also have freedoms that large distilleries don't.Because the larger distilleries produce hundreds of thousands of barrels a year, consistency is very important to those distilleries. Every bottle to taste like every other bottle. But when you’re  producing a few hundred barrels a year, they can experiment and take risks, creating bourbons that push boundaries.He shared stories about experimental mash bills they've tried, about barrels that aged in unexpected ways, about happy accidents that led to new products. It was clear that for smaller distilleries like Glenns Creek, bourbon making is as much about exploration and creativity as it is about tradition and consistency.The distiller also talked passionately about aging, explaining that bourbon doesn't improve linearly with age. It doesn't just get \"better\" the longer it sits in a barrel. There's a sweet spot for each bourbon, depending on the mash bill, the barrel, where it's aging, and even the specific weather patterns during that aging period.They taste barrel samples regularly to determine when each barrel is at its peak.He let us taste a barrel-strength sample straight from a barrel – something I hadn't experienced at the other distilleries. Barrel-proof bourbon is intense, usually coming off the barrel at 125-130 proof (62-65% alcohol). It's hot and powerful, but it's also incredibly flavorful. This is bourbon in its purest form, before water is added to bring it down to bottling strength.Tasting bourbon at barrel proof gave me new appreciation for the proofing process. Adding water isn't just about reducing alcohol content – it's about finding the right proof where the bourbon's flavors are most accessible and balanced.Glenns Creek represents an important part of Kentucky's bourbon story – the small, independent distillers who are keeping the craft element of bourbon making alive, who are willing to experiment and innovate, and who bring passion and personality to an industry that could easily become homogenized and corporate.I left Glenns Creek with a deeper appreciation for the diversity of Kentucky bourbon. The bourbon trail isn't just about visiting famous names – it's about discovering the full spectrum of what bourbon can be.Six Tips For Your Bourbon Trail AdventureIf I've inspired you to plan your own bourbon trail experience, here's some practical advice to help you navigate it successfully:Book Tours Far in Advance: Popular tours at places like Buffalo Trace, Woodford Reserve, and Maker's Mark can sell out 30-90 days ahead, especially during peak seasons (spring and fall). The special tours, like that Flood Tour I did at Buffalo Trace, fill up almost immediately when new dates are announced. Don't wait until you arrive in Kentucky to book tours – do it when you're planning your trip.Plan Your Route Strategically: The bourbon trail distilleries are concentrated in several geographic clusters. The Bardstown area has multiple distilleries within a few miles of each other. The Lexington/Versailles area that I stayed within has another cluster. Louisville has several urban distilleries. Plan your campground or hotel locations to give you reasonable drives to multiple distilleries, and group your visits geographically to minimize backtracking.Limit Daily Distillery Visits: I learned that two distillery visits per day is really the maximum for enjoying each experience fully, unless you’re within a tour company where someone else is driving you around. Tours typically last 60-90 minutes, and that's before you factor in drive time, gift shop browsing, and any meals. Plus, even though you're only getting small tasting samples at each distillery, that alcohol adds up over the course of a day. Stay safe and stay legal – don't overdo it.Ask About Daily Specials: Most distilleries have rotating special releases and discounts that aren't advertised online. Always ask when you arrive if there are any daily specials or limited releases available. I saved significant money and found bottles I couldn't have gotten anywhere else by asking this simple question.Check Operating Days and Hours: Many distilleries are closed one or two days per week, and those closed days aren't always consistent (some close Mondays and Tuesdays, others close Sundays). I learned this the hard way when I couldn't visit Castle & Key because they were closed. Verify operating days and hours before planning your route.Stay Hydrated and Eat Well: This sounds obvious, but it's easy to forget when you're focused on bourbon tasting. Drink plenty of water between distillery visits, eat substantial meals, and don't try to tough it out if you're feeling the effects of alcohol.How Much Did My Bourbon Trail Travel Cost?Let me share some honest talk about costs, because I know many of you are wondering whether a bourbon trail adventure fits your budget.Tour costs varied but were generally reasonable. Most standard distillery tours ranged from $15-25 per person, with premium or specialty tours running $40-75. The tours I chose averaged about $30 each, so four distillery visits cost me roughly $120 in tour fees.Bourbon purchases were my biggest expense, but this was discretionary – you don't have to buy bottles at every distillery, though it's tempting! I spent approximately $400 on bourbon and related products across all four distilleries. That sounds like a lot until you realize that some of these bottles would cost considerably more at home, and several aren't available outside Kentucky at all.Camping costs were minimal thanks to my Thousand Trails membership and AAA discount. Ten nights of camping essentially cost me nothing extra beyond my membership fees, and the additional nights at Kentucky Horse Park were only $45 per night.Get the most recent information and the best price on Thousand Trails campingFood costs were moderate. I ate most meals at the campground, cooking in my RV, which kept costs low. When I did eat out, like that lunch at Ricardo's, I was looking at $20-30 per meal including tip.Fuel costs varied depending on how much driving I did between distilleries. Planning my route efficiently helped minimize this expense, and using my Jeep (30mpg) to travel instead of my RV (9 mpg) made driving in the steep hills not only more enjoyable, but a lot less expensive.Total costs for a long weekend on bourbon trail : approximately $300 for four days, covering tours, bourbon purchases, a restaurant meal, and campsite expenses. Tips for keeping costs manageable:Book standard tours rather than premium tours if budget is a concernBe selective about bottle purchases – you don't need to buy at every distilleryTake advantage of daily specials and discountsCook most meals at your campground rather than eating outPlan your route efficiently to minimize fuel costsLook for free or low-cost activities between distillery visitsWhy I'm Already Planning My ReturnEven as I write this, I'm already thinking my next Kentucky bourbon trail adventure. There's still so much to explore, so many distilleries I didn't visit, so many experiences I want to have.Next time, I want to visit Maker's Mark and see their iconic hand-dipped red wax process. I want to tour Heaven Hill's facilities in Bardstown, the bourbon capital of the world. I want to experience Four Roses' unique approach to bourbon making with their ten different recipes. I want to finally make it to Castle & Key when they're open.I also want to explore more of the craft distillery trail, seeking out those intimate, personality-driven operations that are bringing new energy to Kentucky bourbon. I want to attend the Kentucky Bourbon Festival in Bardstown. I want to time a visit for fall, when the changing leaves make the countryside even more spectacular.But beyond the specific activities, I want to return because Kentucky reminded me why I love this RVing lifestyle. Every destination offers opportunities to learn something new, to challenge yourself, to connect with people and places in meaningful ways. Kentucky delivered on all counts.Have you explored Kentucky's bourbon trail? I'd love to hear about your experiences in thecomments.

I've been enjoying a glass of Kentucky's finest for years, appreciating the smooth warmth and complex flavors. But let me tell you – tasting bourbon and understanding bourbon are two completely different things.My recent four-day exploration of Kentucky's Bourbon Trail transformed me from a casual bourbon drinker into someone who truly appreciates the artistry, science, and heritage behind every bottle. I visited four distilleries, each offering a unique perspective on bourbon production.Where I Stayed For Bourbon Trail ExplorationBefore diving into the bourbon trail, let me share how I approached this adventure from an RV perspective. I split my Kentucky stay between two strategic base camps, each chosen to maximize my access to different clusters of distilleries while minimizing drive time and stress.My first stop was the Thousand Trails Diamond Caverns campground near Cave City. Staying here is free with my Thousand Trails membership, and I enjoyed comfortable camping with full hookups. This location gave me easy access to several distilleries in the southern part of the bourbon trail region, as well as Mammoth Cave National Park.Later, I moved north toKentucky Horse Park State Park Campgroundnear Lexington, paying $45 per night with my AAA discount. This put me right in the heart of bourbon country, surrounded by rolling hills, pristine horse farms, and multiple distilleries within a 30-minute drive. The campground itself was excellent – two double horseshoe-shaped loops, a well-stocked camp store with local products, and even tennis courts. It was the perfect home base for exploring the Lexington-area distilleries.For anyone planning their own bourbon trail RV adventure, strategic campground placement is so important. The bourbon trail distilleries are spread across roughly 100 miles, primarily concentrated in the areas around Louisville, Bardstown, and Lexington. Planning your base camps to minimize backtracking will make your experience much more enjoyable and leave you more energy for appreciating the bourbon rather than fighting fatigue from long drives.Get the most recent information and the best price on Thousand Trails campingUnderstandingthe Kentucky Bourbon TrailThe official Kentucky Bourbon Trail includes approximately 38 distilleries, though the number can vary as new distilleries join or offerings change. There's also the Kentucky Bourbon Trail Craft Tour, which features smaller, craft distilleries. Combined, there are around 57-60 distilleries you could potentially visit across the region.Kentucky produces roughly 95% of the world's bourbon, and there are more barrels of bourbon aging in Kentucky right now than there are people living in the state. Millions and millions of barrels, quietly resting in warehouses across this beautiful state, developing the flavors that will eventually be enjoyed around the world.But why Kentucky? What makes this state so perfect for bourbon production? The answer lies in several factors: the limestone-filtered water that's naturally iron-free and mineral-rich, the climate with its hot summers and cold winters that push bourbon in and out of the barrel wood, and centuries of accumulated knowledge and tradition. You can make bourbon anywhere in the United States legally, but you can't replicate the Kentucky natural environment.I knew I couldn't visit all the distilleries in one trip, so I carefully selected four that would give me a well-rounded introduction: a small craft distillery with unique connections, a major heritage distillery with deep history, a premium distillery known for its visitor experience, and another craft operation offering intimate tastings. Each one taught me something different about bourbon production and Kentucky culture.Stop One:Balance Distilling Co.My bourbon education began atBalance Distilling Co.. Balance is a privately-owned craft distillery, the kind of operation where you can still feel the passion and personal investment in every aspect of production.Walking into Balance Distillery felt like discovering a hidden place tucked into the hills of Kentucky. This isn't a massive commercial operation churning out millions of bottles annually – this is a family business where craftsmanship takes precedence over volume.My tour started with those beautiful copper pot stills, and my guide explained why copper is essential to quality spirits production. Copper naturally removes sulfur compounds during distillation, which would otherwise create unpleasant flavors in the final product. That's why virtually every quality distillery, whether making bourbon, scotch, or any other spirit, uses copper stills or copper elements in their distillation process. The stills at Balance aren't just functional equipment – they're works of art, gleaming and well-maintained, testament to the care this operation takes with every aspect of production.What really fascinated me was learning that Balance produces not just bourbon, but also rum, gin, and moonshine. I was told their goal is to keep the recipes original to the historical recipes  of the Prohibition.Each spirit requires its own unique techniques, its own carefully calibrated processes. The bourbon-making process alone involves countless variables: the specific grain recipe, the particular strain of yeast, the char level on the oak barrels, the location where those barrels age in the warehouse, even the weather patterns during the aging period. Every single decision impacts the final flavor profile.The guide walked me through the entire bourbon production process, from grain to glass.Here's what makes Balance truly special and relevant to my Kentucky adventure: they hold the trademark for Mammoth Cave Bourbon. After spending time exploring that magnificent cave system, discovering that there's a bourbon named after it felt like finding the perfect Kentucky connection.And here's a fun fact that bourbon lovers will appreciate – Balance Distillery's Mammoth Cave Bourbon is sold in the gift shop at Mammoth Cave National Park, making it one of only two National Parks in the entire United States that sell local alcohol in their gift shops.The tasting at Balance was my first real lesson in bourbon appreciation. My guide taught me the proper technique: first, observe the color (which tells you about barrel char and aging time). Then, nose the bourbon – but never stick your nose directly in the glass, as the alcohol will overpower everything. Instead, hold the glass a few inches away and gently waft the aroma toward you. Take a small sip and let it coat your entire mouth before swallowing, then pay attention to the finish – the flavors that linger after you swallow.Each bourbon Balance produces has a distinct character. Their standard bourbon showcases classic notes of caramel and vanilla with a gentle spice. Their higher-rye expression brings more pepper and cinnamon to the forefront. Learning to identify these differences was like learning a new language – one I was eager to become fluent in.I left Balance with not just bottles of bourbon, but with a foundation of knowledge that would inform every subsequent distillery visit. Understanding the basics of bourbon production at a smaller, craft operation made it easier to appreciate the scale and complexity of the larger distilleries I'd visit next.Stop Two:Buffalo Trace DistilleryIf Balance Distillery was bourbon school's introductory course,Buffalo Tracewas the advanced seminar. This is one ofKentucky's most famous distilleries, producing brands like Buffalo Trace, Eagle Rare, Blanton's, Pappy Van Winkle, and many others.It's a National Historic Landmark with a history stretching back to 1773 - making it one of the oldest continuously operating distilleries in the United States.Getting there in my RV was its own adventure. Buffalo Trace's RV parking lot required some careful maneuvering, especially since there was a festival happening that day and the parking area was packed. I'm traveling with a 41-foot total rig (motorhome plus towed car), and finding a spot I could both fit into and eventually get out of took some concentration and patience.I was surprised how full the parking lot was, and I had to leave the area, cross the street, and come back in again so I could approach the one remaining RV parking space and park both my RV and my Jeep in straight.Here's where Buffalo Trace demonstrated the kind of hospitality that makes Kentucky special: they have a trolley service that picks up visitors from the RV lot and brings them to the main visitor center. Because I was running close to my scheduled tour time, they drove me over separately and escorted me right to the front of a very long line.VIP treatment! For anyone planning to visit Buffalo Trace in an RV, know that they genuinely want to accommodate you – just allow extra time for parking and transportation.I had booked about a week in advance for something called the Flood Tour, and getting into this tour was like winning the bourbon lottery. They only offered it six times, and I managed to secure a spot on the very last one. The tour was led by the general manager himself, which meant we were getting information and stories from someone with intimate knowledge of every aspect of the operation.The Flood Tour focused on the devastating 1937 flood that nearly destroyed the distillery (then called George T. Stagg Distillery). The Ohio River crested at over 47.46 feet, and water reached the second floor of many distillery buildings. Our guide showed us photographs of workers in boats rowing between buildings, of barrels floating in warehouses, of the massive cleanup and rebuilding effort that followed.Buffalo Trace is currently still cleaning up from the most recent, and flood of 2025, where the water from the Kentucky River crested at 48.27 feet . Although many of the flood effects could only be noticed if pointed out by someone who actually participated in the cleanup.Standing in the very buildings that have survived flooding, hearing stories about how workers risked their lives to save precious barrels and protect the distillery's most valuable assets through several floods, brought history to life in a way that reading about it never could. The resilience and determination it took to rebuild and continue making bourbon through that disaster was inspiring. Buffalo Trace didn't just survive – they emerged stronger, with new systems in place to protect against future flooding.But the tour wasn't just about history. We walked through active production areas, seeing the fermentation tanks bubbling with working mash, smelling the sweet, yeasty aroma that fills the air around fermenting bourbon. We visited the still house, where massive copper column stills work continuously, converting fermented mash into new-make spirit (what bourbon is called before it goes into barrels).The aroma of the mash throughout the distillery was intoxicating. I suggested to the general manager that they should somehow make a candle scent to duplicate it.Then came the barrel warehouses, and this is where you really understand the scale of bourbon production. These aren't small storage rooms – they're massive multi-story buildings, each holding tens of thousands of barrels. Our guide explained that Buffalo Trace produces about 400-500 barrels per day, every single day. Those barrels will age for anywhere from four to 23+ years, depending on the brand and expression.The location of barrels within these warehouses matters enormously. Top-floor barrels experience dramatic temperature swings – scorching hot in summer, freezing in winter. This temperature variation pushes the bourbon deep into the barrel wood in summer, extracting color and flavor, then pulls it back out in winter, bringing those wood-derived compounds into the bourbon. Bottom-floor barrels age more slowly and evenly, with less temperature variation.This is why single-barrel bourbons from the same distillery, even aged for the same amount of time, can taste dramatically different. One barrel might have spent its life on the top floor of a hot warehouse, developing intense flavors. Another might have aged on a cool bottom floor, resulting in a gentler profile. The master distiller's job is to understand these differences and either blend barrels to achieve consistency (for standard expressions) or select exceptional single barrels that showcase unique characteristics.The tasting at the end of the Flood Tour included several spirits we couldn't have tried anywhere else – limited releases, barrel-proof versions, and experimental bourbons that never make it to general distribution. Each pour came with stories about the specific barrels selected, the aging conditions, and the flavor profile the distillers were trying to achieve.Our guide also shared an invaluable tip: look for Buffalo Trace's daily specials. They rotate special bottle releases and discounts regularly, and if you're lucky, you might find something rare or get a significant discount on bottles that would cost considerably more elsewhere. I took advantage of a special that day and came home with some bourbon I probably never would have found at my local liquor store.Stop Three:Woodford ReserveThe next day, I headed to another National Landmark property,Woodford Reserve, and I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised.After the crowds at Buffalo Trace, I was expecting long lines and chaos. Instead, I walking right in with virtually no wait.Sometimes timing is everything, and my morning arrival on Monday hit a perfect lull between tours.I had booked what they call a \"senses tour,\" and this experience revolutionized my understanding of bourbon appreciation. Instead of just sipping different bourbons and trying to describe what we tasted, they paired each whiskey with specific foods that brought out completely different flavor notes. It was a revelation.Our guide started by explaining that bourbon, like wine, has an incredibly complex flavor profile with hundreds of distinct compounds. But unlike wine, where you can often taste the grape variety and growing region, bourbon's flavors come primarily from three sources: the grain (contributing sweet, grainy, or spicy notes), the yeast (adding fruity or floral elements), and the barrel (providing vanilla, caramel, oak, and spice from the charred wood).Then came the practical demonstration. First, we tasted Woodford Reserve's classic bourbon neat – no food, no ice, just the bourbon itself. I could identify vanilla, caramel, maybe some spice on the finish. Nice, but relatively straightforward.Then we tasted the same bourbon with a piece of dark chocolate. Suddenly, the vanilla and caramel notes exploded. The chocolate somehow brought those flavors forward, making them more pronounced and distinct. It was like the bourbon had transformed into something completely different.Next, we paired that same bourbon with a salted pretzel. Boom – another complete transformation. Now the spice notes came forward. The salt emphasized the char from the barrel and the rye spice in the mash bill. The caramel and vanilla receded into the background, letting the bolder flavors shine.We continued through several more pairings – bourbon with aged cheddar (highlighting savory notes), bourbon with dried cherry (emphasizing fruit notes), bourbon with toasted pecans (bringing out nuttiness I hadn't noticed before). Each combination revealed different aspects of the same bourbon.The lesson was clear: bourbon isn't one-dimensional. A good bourbon has enough complexity that different foods can highlight different aspects of its flavor profile. Our guide explained that this is why bourbon works so beautifully with food, and why thoughtful pairings can enhance both the food and the bourbon.He recommended specific pairings for different bourbon styles: wheated bourbons (like Maker's Mark), which are softer and sweeter, pair beautifully with desserts and mild cheeses. High-rye bourbons (like Woodford Reserve or Four Roses), which are spicier and bolder, work better with savory dishes, grilled meats, or strong cheeses. Barrel-proof bourbons can stand up to intensely flavored foods that would overwhelm lower-proof spirits.We toured the production facilities, seeing the small fermentation tanks (Woodford uses smaller tanks than most large distilleries, believing it allows for better temperature control and more consistent fermentation), the gleaming copper stills, and the bottling line where finished bourbon is carefully filtered, proofed down to bottling strength, and packaged.The property itself is stunning – a National Historic Landmark with buildings dating back to the 1800s, surrounded by rolling Kentucky hills. A natural spring on the property provides their water source, and our guide explained that water quality is crucial to bourbon production. Kentucky's limestone-filtered water naturally removes iron (which would create off-flavors) and adds minerals that yeast loves. It's one of the geological advantages that makes Kentucky so perfect for bourbon production.Woodford Reserve also taught me that both they and Buffalo Trace offer multiple different tour types, each with different themes and different whiskeys to sample. The offerings rotate, so if you returned on a different day or in a different season, you could have a completely different experience. That's definitely something I'm keeping in mind for future visits – you could visit the same distillery multiple times and always learn something new.Lunch Break atRicardo's Grill and PubWith a couple hours between my Woodford Reserve tour and my next distillery visit, I decided to treat myself to lunch atRicardo'sin Versailles. Yes, Versailles – but it's pronounced \"Ver-SAILS\" in Kentucky, not like the palace in France. I learned that the hard way when asking for directions!Ricardo's is housed in an old train station, and walking in felt like stepping back to a different era. The building has retained so much of its original character – soaring ceilings, exposed brick walls, old wooden floors worn smooth by decades of foot traffic, and massive windows overlooking what used to be the railway platform where passengers waited for trains.I ordered the catfish – and it was exceptional. Sitting there with my lunch and a glass of sweet tea, watching life go by in this small Kentucky town, I felt completely content.This is one of the unexpected joys of solo travel – these quiet moments where you can just be present, soaking in the atmosphere of a place without having to coordinate with anyone else or maintain conversation. The server chatted with me about the bourbon trail, recommended some back roads for scenic driving, and treated me like a welcomed guest rather than just another tourist passing through.Kentucky hospitality is real. It's not just a marketing slogan. Throughout my entire bourbon trail experience, from distillery staff to restaurant servers to fellow travelers I met along the way, everyone embodied a genuine warmth and eagerness to share what makes their state special.Bourbon Country Roads and SceneryI want to take a moment to talk about the drives between distilleries, because the journey is just as much a part of the bourbon trail experience as the destinations themselves.Kentucky bourbon country is absolutely beautiful. The landscape consists of gentle, rolling hills covered in that famous Kentucky bluegrass (which is actually green, despite the name). White board fences mark property boundaries, creating picturesque patterns across the hillsides. Thoroughbred horses graze peacefully in pristine pastures. Old tobacco barns, weathering gracefully, dot the countryside as reminders of Kentucky's agricultural heritage.On the road to my final distillery stop, I passed several massive brick warehouses owned by Jim Beam. These aren't just storage buildings – they're where millions of gallons of bourbon are quietly aging right now, developing the flavors that will eventually be enjoyed around the world. Seeing those warehouses from the road, knowing what's inside, made me appreciate the scale of Kentucky's bourbon industry. This isn't just a tourist attraction – it's a living, working industry that's central to Kentucky's economy and identity.There's something meditative about driving through this landscape. With the windows down on a beautiful day, you can smell the grass, occasionally catch the sweet aroma from nearby distilleries, and just soak in the peaceful beauty of rural Kentucky. I found myself taking back roads whenever possible, preferring the scenic route over faster highways.For RV travelers, these back roads are generally narrow with many low-lying branches, one-lane bridges and lots of twists and turns.  Both Buffalo Trace and Woodford have places large enough for RVs to park, but Buffalo Trace was the only one of a main road.  I would not have felt comfortable driving my rig through bourbon country, except on the main roads. Have my Jeep with me made the tour a lot more enjoyable.You can also rent a tour guide and driver to take you around, avoiding driving altogether!Stop Four:Glenns Creek DistillingMy final distillery tour was atGlenns Creek, a smaller, privately-owned operation that had taken over the Old Crow distillery buildings some years back.After the larger, more polished operations at Buffalo Trace and Woodford Reserve, Glenns Creek felt refreshingly intimate and unvarnished.This wasn't a huge tour group following a scripted presentation – it was just a small group of genuine bourbon enthusiasts gathering around a table with one of Glenns Creek's distillers for a tasting and open-ended question-and-answer session. It felt less like a tour and more like sitting down with a knowledgeable friend who happens to make exceptional bourbon.What struck me immediately was how different Glenns Creek bourbons tasted compared to the others I'd sampled. These expressions were sharper, spicier, with more bite and character. They weren't smooth in the traditional sense – they were bold and unapologetic.The distiller explained their philosophy: they're not trying to make bourbon that tastes like Buffalo Trace or Woodford Reserve or any other established brand. They're creating something distinctively their own, and they're not afraid to push boundaries.Glenns Creek uses a higher rye content in their mash bill, which gives their bourbon that distinctive spicy, peppery profile. They also use a heavier char on their barrels – a char level that many larger distilleries would consider too aggressive. And they intentionally age their whiskey in parts of their warehouses where temperature fluctuations are more dramatic, accelerating the interaction between bourbon and barrel wood.The result is bourbon that demands attention. It's not background music – it's a bold statement. Some people love it immediately. Others need to adjust their palate. But nobody tastes Glenns Creek bourbon and forgets it.During our discussion, the distiller opened up about the challenges smaller distilleries face. They can't achieve the economies of scale that the big names do. They can't get the same distribution. They can't spend millions on marketing. But they also have freedoms that large distilleries don't.Because the larger distilleries produce hundreds of thousands of barrels a year, consistency is very important to those distilleries. Every bottle to taste like every other bottle. But when you’re  producing a few hundred barrels a year, they can experiment and take risks, creating bourbons that push boundaries.He shared stories about experimental mash bills they've tried, about barrels that aged in unexpected ways, about happy accidents that led to new products. It was clear that for smaller distilleries like Glenns Creek, bourbon making is as much about exploration and creativity as it is about tradition and consistency.The distiller also talked passionately about aging, explaining that bourbon doesn't improve linearly with age. It doesn't just get \"better\" the longer it sits in a barrel. There's a sweet spot for each bourbon, depending on the mash bill, the barrel, where it's aging, and even the specific weather patterns during that aging period.They taste barrel samples regularly to determine when each barrel is at its peak.He let us taste a barrel-strength sample straight from a barrel – something I hadn't experienced at the other distilleries. Barrel-proof bourbon is intense, usually coming off the barrel at 125-130 proof (62-65% alcohol). It's hot and powerful, but it's also incredibly flavorful. This is bourbon in its purest form, before water is added to bring it down to bottling strength.Tasting bourbon at barrel proof gave me new appreciation for the proofing process. Adding water isn't just about reducing alcohol content – it's about finding the right proof where the bourbon's flavors are most accessible and balanced.Glenns Creek represents an important part of Kentucky's bourbon story – the small, independent distillers who are keeping the craft element of bourbon making alive, who are willing to experiment and innovate, and who bring passion and personality to an industry that could easily become homogenized and corporate.I left Glenns Creek with a deeper appreciation for the diversity of Kentucky bourbon. The bourbon trail isn't just about visiting famous names – it's about discovering the full spectrum of what bourbon can be.Six Tips For Your Bourbon Trail AdventureIf I've inspired you to plan your own bourbon trail experience, here's some practical advice to help you navigate it successfully:Book Tours Far in Advance: Popular tours at places like Buffalo Trace, Woodford Reserve, and Maker's Mark can sell out 30-90 days ahead, especially during peak seasons (spring and fall). The special tours, like that Flood Tour I did at Buffalo Trace, fill up almost immediately when new dates are announced. Don't wait until you arrive in Kentucky to book tours – do it when you're planning your trip.Plan Your Route Strategically: The bourbon trail distilleries are concentrated in several geographic clusters. The Bardstown area has multiple distilleries within a few miles of each other. The Lexington/Versailles area that I stayed within has another cluster. Louisville has several urban distilleries. Plan your campground or hotel locations to give you reasonable drives to multiple distilleries, and group your visits geographically to minimize backtracking.Limit Daily Distillery Visits: I learned that two distillery visits per day is really the maximum for enjoying each experience fully, unless you’re within a tour company where someone else is driving you around. Tours typically last 60-90 minutes, and that's before you factor in drive time, gift shop browsing, and any meals. Plus, even though you're only getting small tasting samples at each distillery, that alcohol adds up over the course of a day. Stay safe and stay legal – don't overdo it.Ask About Daily Specials: Most distilleries have rotating special releases and discounts that aren't advertised online. Always ask when you arrive if there are any daily specials or limited releases available. I saved significant money and found bottles I couldn't have gotten anywhere else by asking this simple question.Check Operating Days and Hours: Many distilleries are closed one or two days per week, and those closed days aren't always consistent (some close Mondays and Tuesdays, others close Sundays). I learned this the hard way when I couldn't visit Castle & Key because they were closed. Verify operating days and hours before planning your route.Stay Hydrated and Eat Well: This sounds obvious, but it's easy to forget when you're focused on bourbon tasting. Drink plenty of water between distillery visits, eat substantial meals, and don't try to tough it out if you're feeling the effects of alcohol.How Much Did My Bourbon Trail Travel Cost?Let me share some honest talk about costs, because I know many of you are wondering whether a bourbon trail adventure fits your budget.Tour costs varied but were generally reasonable. Most standard distillery tours ranged from $15-25 per person, with premium or specialty tours running $40-75. The tours I chose averaged about $30 each, so four distillery visits cost me roughly $120 in tour fees.Bourbon purchases were my biggest expense, but this was discretionary – you don't have to buy bottles at every distillery, though it's tempting! I spent approximately $400 on bourbon and related products across all four distilleries. That sounds like a lot until you realize that some of these bottles would cost considerably more at home, and several aren't available outside Kentucky at all.Camping costs were minimal thanks to my Thousand Trails membership and AAA discount. Ten nights of camping essentially cost me nothing extra beyond my membership fees, and the additional nights at Kentucky Horse Park were only $45 per night.Get the most recent information and the best price on Thousand Trails campingFood costs were moderate. I ate most meals at the campground, cooking in my RV, which kept costs low. When I did eat out, like that lunch at Ricardo's, I was looking at $20-30 per meal including tip.Fuel costs varied depending on how much driving I did between distilleries. Planning my route efficiently helped minimize this expense, and using my Jeep (30mpg) to travel instead of my RV (9 mpg) made driving in the steep hills not only more enjoyable, but a lot less expensive.Total costs for a long weekend on bourbon trail : approximately $300 for four days, covering tours, bourbon purchases, a restaurant meal, and campsite expenses. Tips for keeping costs manageable:Book standard tours rather than premium tours if budget is a concernBe selective about bottle purchases – you don't need to buy at every distilleryTake advantage of daily specials and discountsCook most meals at your campground rather than eating outPlan your route efficiently to minimize fuel costsLook for free or low-cost activities between distillery visitsWhy I'm Already Planning My ReturnEven as I write this, I'm already thinking my next Kentucky bourbon trail adventure. There's still so much to explore, so many distilleries I didn't visit, so many experiences I want to have.Next time, I want to visit Maker's Mark and see their iconic hand-dipped red wax process. I want to tour Heaven Hill's facilities in Bardstown, the bourbon capital of the world. I want to experience Four Roses' unique approach to bourbon making with their ten different recipes. I want to finally make it to Castle & Key when they're open.I also want to explore more of the craft distillery trail, seeking out those intimate, personality-driven operations that are bringing new energy to Kentucky bourbon. I want to attend the Kentucky Bourbon Festival in Bardstown. I want to time a visit for fall, when the changing leaves make the countryside even more spectacular.But beyond the specific activities, I want to return because Kentucky reminded me why I love this RVing lifestyle. Every destination offers opportunities to learn something new, to challenge yourself, to connect with people and places in meaningful ways.

      "Where I Stayed For Bourbon Trail Exploration",
      "Before diving into the bourbon trail, let me share how I approached this adventure from an RV perspective. I split my Kentucky stay between two strategic base camps, each chosen to maximize my access to different clusters of distilleries while minimizing drive time and stress.My first stop was the Thousand Trails Diamond Caverns campground near Cave City. Staying here is free with my Thousand Trails membership, and I enjoyed comfortable camping with full hookups. This location gave me easy access to several distilleries in the southern part of the bourbon trail region, as well as Mammoth Cave National Park.Later, I moved north toKentucky Horse Park State Park Campgroundnear Lexington, paying $45 per night with my AAA discount. This put me right in the heart of bourbon country, surrounded by rolling hills, pristine horse farms, and multiple distilleries within a 30-minute drive. The campground itself was excellent – two double horseshoe-shaped loops, a well-stocked camp store with local products, and even tennis courts. It was the perfect home base for exploring the Lexington-area distilleries.For anyone planning their own bourbon trail RV adventure, strategic campground placement is so important. The bourbon trail distilleries are spread across roughly 100 miles, primarily concentrated in the areas around Louisville, Bardstown, and Lexington. Planning your base camps to minimize backtracking will make your experience much more enjoyable and leave you more energy for appreciating the bourbon rather than fighting fatigue from long drives.",

      "The official Kentucky Bourbon Trail includes approximately 38 distilleries, though the number can vary as new distilleries join or offerings change. There's also the Kentucky Bourbon Trail Craft Tour, which features smaller, craft distilleries. Combined, there are around 57-60 distilleries you could potentially visit across the region.Kentucky produces roughly 95% of the world's bourbon, and there are more barrels of bourbon aging in Kentucky right now than there are people living in the state. Millions and millions of barrels, quietly resting in warehouses across this beautiful state, developing the flavors that will eventually be enjoyed around the world.But why Kentucky?

      "The tasting at Balance was my first real lesson in bourbon appreciation. My guide taught me the proper technique: first, observe the color (which tells you about barrel char and aging time). Then, nose the bourbon – but never stick your nose directly in the glass, as the alcohol will overpower everything. Instead, hold the glass a few inches away and gently waft the aroma toward you. Take a small sip and let it coat your entire mouth before swallowing, then pay attention to the finish – the flavors that linger after you swallow.Each bourbon Balance produces has a distinct character. Their standard bourbon showcases classic notes of caramel and vanilla with a gentle spice. Their higher-rye expression brings more pepper and cinnamon to the forefront. Learning to identify these differences was like learning a new language – one I was eager to become fluent in.I left Balance with not just bottles of bourbon, but with a foundation of knowledge that would inform every subsequent distillery visit. Understanding the basics of bourbon production at a smaller, craft operation made it easier to appreciate the scale and complexity of the larger distilleries I'd visit next.",
      "The tasting at Balance was my first real lesson in bourbon appreciation. My guide taught me the proper technique: first, observe the color (which tells you about barrel char and aging time). Then, nose the bourbon – but never stick your nose directly in the glass, as the alcohol will overpower everything. Instead, hold the glass a few inches away and gently waft the aroma toward you. Take a small sip and let it coat your entire mouth before swallowing, then pay attention to the finish – the flavors that linger after you swallow.",
      "Each bourbon Balance produces has a distinct character. Their standard bourbon showcases classic notes of caramel and vanilla with a gentle spice. Their higher-rye expression brings more pepper and cinnamon to the forefront. Learning to identify these differences was like learning a new language – one I was eager to become fluent in.",

      "Stop Two:Buffalo Trace Distillery",
      "If Balance Distillery was bourbon school's introductory course,Buffalo Tracewas the advanced seminar. This is one ofKentucky's most famous distilleries, producing brands like Buffalo Trace, Eagle Rare, Blanton's, Pappy Van Winkle, and many others.It's a National Historic Landmark with a history stretching back to 1773 - making it one of the oldest continuously operating distilleries in the United States.Getting there in my RV was its own adventure. Buffalo Trace's RV parking lot required some careful maneuvering, especially since there was a festival happening that day and the parking area was packed. I'm traveling with a 41-foot total rig (motorhome plus towed car), and finding a spot I could both fit into and eventually get out of took some concentration and patience.I was surprised how full the parking lot was, and I had to leave the area, cross the street, and come back in again so I could approach the one remaining RV parking space and park both my RV and my Jeep in straight.Here's where Buffalo Trace demonstrated the kind of hospitality that makes Kentucky special: they have a trolley service that picks up visitors from the RV lot and brings them to the main visitor center. Because I was running close to my scheduled tour time, they drove me over separately and escorted me right to the front of a very long line.VIP treatment! For anyone planning to visit Buffalo Trace in an RV, know that they genuinely want to accommodate you – just allow extra time for parking and transportation.",

      "I had booked about a week in advance for something called the Flood Tour, and getting into this tour was like winning the bourbon lottery. They only offered it six times, and I managed to secure a spot on the very last one. The tour was led by the general manager himself, which meant we were getting information and stories from someone with intimate knowledge of every aspect of the operation.The Flood Tour focused on the devastating 1937 flood that nearly destroyed the distillery (then called George T. Stagg Distillery). The Ohio River crested at over 47.46 feet, and water reached the second floor of many distillery buildings. Our guide showed us photographs of workers in boats rowing between buildings, of barrels floating in warehouses, of the massive cleanup and rebuilding effort that followed.Buffalo Trace is currently still cleaning up from the most recent, and flood of 2025, where the water from the Kentucky River crested at 48.27 feet .

      "Standing in the very buildings that have survived flooding, hearing stories about how workers risked their lives to save precious barrels and protect the distillery's most valuable assets through several floods, brought history to life in a way that reading about it never could. The resilience and determination it took to rebuild and continue making bourbon through that disaster was inspiring. Buffalo Trace didn't just survive – they emerged stronger, with new systems in place to protect against future flooding.But the tour wasn't just about history. We walked through active production areas, seeing the fermentation tanks bubbling with working mash, smelling the sweet, yeasty aroma that fills the air around fermenting bourbon. We visited the still house, where massive copper column stills work continuously, converting fermented mash into new-make spirit (what bourbon is called before it goes into barrels).The aroma of the mash throughout the distillery was intoxicating. I suggested to the general manager that they should somehow make a candle scent to duplicate it.",

      "Then came the barrel warehouses, and this is where you really understand the scale of bourbon production. These aren't small storage rooms – they're massive multi-story buildings, each holding tens of thousands of barrels. Our guide explained that Buffalo Trace produces about 400-500 barrels per day, every single day. Those barrels will age for anywhere from four to 23+ years, depending on the brand and expression.The location of barrels within these warehouses matters enormously. Top-floor barrels experience dramatic temperature swings – scorching hot in summer, freezing in winter. This temperature variation pushes the bourbon deep into the barrel wood in summer, extracting color and flavor, then pulls it back out in winter, bringing those wood-derived compounds into the bourbon. Bottom-floor barrels age more slowly and evenly, with less temperature variation.This is why single-barrel bourbons from the same distillery, even aged for the same amount of time, can taste dramatically different. One barrel might have spent its life on the top floor of a hot warehouse, developing intense flavors. Another might have aged on a cool bottom floor, resulting in a gentler profile. The master distiller's job is to understand these differences and either blend barrels to achieve consistency (for standard expressions) or select exceptional single barrels that showcase unique characteristics.",

      "The tasting at the end of the Flood Tour included several spirits we couldn't have tried anywhere else – limited releases, barrel-proof versions, and experimental bourbons that never make it to general distribution. Each pour came with stories about the specific barrels selected, the aging conditions, and the flavor profile the distillers were trying to achieve.Our guide also shared an invaluable tip: look for Buffalo Trace's daily specials. They rotate special bottle releases and discounts regularly, and if you're lucky, you might find something rare or get a significant discount on bottles that would cost considerably more elsewhere. I took advantage of a special that day and came home with some bourbon I probably never would have found at my local liquor store.",

      "After the crowds at Buffalo Trace, I was expecting long lines and chaos. Instead, I walking right in with virtually no wait.Sometimes timing is everything, and my morning arrival on Monday hit a perfect lull between tours.I had booked what they call a \"senses tour,\" and this experience revolutionized my understanding of bourbon appreciation. Instead of just sipping different bourbons and trying to describe what we tasted, they paired each whiskey with specific foods that brought out completely different flavor notes. It was a revelation.Our guide started by explaining that bourbon, like wine, has an incredibly complex flavor profile with hundreds of distinct compounds. But unlike wine, where you can often taste the grape variety and growing region, bourbon's flavors come primarily from three sources: the grain (contributing sweet, grainy, or spicy notes), the yeast (adding fruity or floral elements), and the barrel (providing vanilla, caramel, oak, and spice from the charred wood).",

      "Then came the practical demonstration. First, we tasted Woodford Reserve's classic bourbon neat – no food, no ice, just the bourbon itself. I could identify vanilla, caramel, maybe some spice on the finish. Nice, but relatively straightforward.Then we tasted the same bourbon with a piece of dark chocolate. Suddenly, the vanilla and caramel notes exploded. The chocolate somehow brought those flavors forward, making them more pronounced and distinct. It was like the bourbon had transformed into something completely different.Next, we paired that same bourbon with a salted pretzel. Boom – another complete transformation. Now the spice notes came forward. The salt emphasized the char from the barrel and the rye spice in the mash bill. The caramel and vanilla receded into the background, letting the bolder flavors shine.We continued through several more pairings – bourbon with aged cheddar (highlighting savory notes), bourbon with dried cherry (emphasizing fruit notes), bourbon with toasted pecans (bringing out nuttiness I hadn't noticed before). Each combination revealed different aspects of the same bourbon.The lesson was clear: bourbon isn't one-dimensional. A good bourbon has enough complexity that different foods can highlight different aspects of its flavor profile. Our guide explained that this is why bourbon works so beautifully with food, and why thoughtful pairings can enhance both the food and the bourbon.He recommended specific pairings for different bourbon styles: wheated bourbons (like Maker's Mark), which are softer and sweeter, pair beautifully with desserts and mild cheeses. High-rye bourbons (like Woodford Reserve or Four Roses), which are spicier and bolder, work better with savory dishes, grilled meats, or strong cheeses. Barrel-proof bourbons can stand up to intensely flavored foods that would overwhelm lower-proof spirits.",

      "We toured the production facilities, seeing the small fermentation tanks (Woodford uses smaller tanks than most large distilleries, believing it allows for better temperature control and more consistent fermentation), the gleaming copper stills, and the bottling line where finished bourbon is carefully filtered, proofed down to bottling strength, and packaged.The property itself is stunning – a National Historic Landmark with buildings dating back to the 1800s, surrounded by rolling Kentucky hills. A natural spring on the property provides their water source, and our guide explained that water quality is crucial to bourbon production. Kentucky's limestone-filtered water naturally removes iron (which would create off-flavors) and adds minerals that yeast loves. It's one of the geological advantages that makes Kentucky so perfect for bourbon production.Woodford Reserve also taught me that both they and Buffalo Trace offer multiple different tour types, each with different themes and different whiskeys to sample. The offerings rotate, so if you returned on a different day or in a different season, you could have a completely different experience. That's definitely something I'm keeping in mind for future visits – you could visit the same distillery multiple times and always learn something new.",

      "Bourbon Country Roads and Scenery",
      "I want to take a moment to talk about the drives between distilleries, because the journey is just as much a part of the bourbon trail experience as the destinations themselves.Kentucky bourbon country is absolutely beautiful. The landscape consists of gentle, rolling hills covered in that famous Kentucky bluegrass (which is actually green, despite the name). White board fences mark property boundaries, creating picturesque patterns across the hillsides. Thoroughbred horses graze peacefully in pristine pastures. Old tobacco barns, weathering gracefully, dot the countryside as reminders of Kentucky's agricultural heritage.On the road to my final distillery stop, I passed several massive brick warehouses owned by Jim Beam. These aren't just storage buildings – they're where millions of gallons of bourbon are quietly aging right now, developing the flavors that will eventually be enjoyed around the world. Seeing those warehouses from the road, knowing what's inside, made me appreciate the scale of Kentucky's bourbon industry. This isn't just a tourist attraction – it's a living, working industry that's central to Kentucky's economy and identity.There's something meditative about driving through this landscape. With the windows down on a beautiful day, you can smell the grass, occasionally catch the sweet aroma from nearby distilleries, and just soak in the peaceful beauty of rural Kentucky. I found myself taking back roads whenever possible, preferring the scenic route over faster highways.For RV travelers, these back roads are generally narrow with many low-lying branches, one-lane bridges and lots of twists and turns.  Both Buffalo Trace and Woodford have places large enough for RVs to park, but Buffalo Trace was the only one of a main road.  I would not have felt comfortable driving my rig through bourbon country, except on the main roads. Have my Jeep with me made the tour a lot more enjoyable.You can also rent a tour guide and driver to take you around, avoiding driving altogether!",

      "Stop Four:Glenns Creek Distilling",
      "My final distillery tour was atGlenns Creek, a smaller, privately-owned operation that had taken over the Old Crow distillery buildings some years back.After the larger, more polished operations at Buffalo Trace and Woodford Reserve, Glenns Creek felt refreshingly intimate and unvarnished.This wasn't a huge tour group following a scripted presentation – it was just a small group of genuine bourbon enthusiasts gathering around a table with one of Glenns Creek's distillers for a tasting and open-ended question-and-answer session. It felt less like a tour and more like sitting down with a knowledgeable friend who happens to make exceptional bourbon.What struck me immediately was how different Glenns Creek bourbons tasted compared to the others I'd sampled. These expressions were sharper, spicier, with more bite and character. They weren't smooth in the traditional sense – they were bold and unapologetic.The distiller explained their philosophy: they're not trying to make bourbon that tastes like Buffalo Trace or Woodford Reserve or any other established brand. They're creating something distinctively their own, and they're not afraid to push boundaries.Glenns Creek uses a higher rye content in their mash bill, which gives their bourbon that distinctive spicy, peppery profile. They also use a heavier char on their barrels – a char level that many larger distilleries would consider too aggressive. And they intentionally age their whiskey in parts of their warehouses where temperature fluctuations are more dramatic, accelerating the interaction between bourbon and barrel wood.The result is bourbon that demands attention. It's not background music – it's a bold statement. Some people love it immediately. Others need to adjust their palate. But nobody tastes Glenns Creek bourbon and forgets it.During our discussion, the distiller opened up about the challenges smaller distilleries face. They can't achieve the economies of scale that the big names do. They can't get the same distribution. They can't spend millions on marketing. But they also have freedoms that large distilleries don't.Because the larger distilleries produce hundreds of thousands of barrels a year, consistency is very important to those distilleries. Every bottle to taste like every other bottle. But when you’re  producing a few hundred barrels a year, they can experiment and take risks, creating bourbons that push boundaries.He shared stories about experimental mash bills they've tried, about barrels that aged in unexpected ways, about happy accidents that led to new products. It was clear that for smaller distilleries like Glenns Creek, bourbon making is as much about exploration and creativity as it is about tradition and consistency.The distiller also talked passionately about aging, explaining that bourbon doesn't improve linearly with age. It doesn't just get \"better\" the longer it sits in a barrel. There's a sweet spot for each bourbon, depending on the mash bill, the barrel, where it's aging, and even the specific weather patterns during that aging period.They taste barrel samples regularly to determine when each barrel is at its peak.He let us taste a barrel-strength sample straight from a barrel – something I hadn't experienced at the other distilleries. Barrel-proof bourbon is intense, usually coming off the barrel at 125-130 proof (62-65% alcohol). It's hot and powerful, but it's also incredibly flavorful. This is bourbon in its purest form, before water is added to bring it down to bottling strength.Tasting bourbon at barrel proof gave me new appreciation for the proofing process. Adding water isn't just about reducing alcohol content – it's about finding the right proof where the bourbon's flavors are most accessible and balanced.Glenns Creek represents an important part of Kentucky's bourbon story – the small, independent distillers who are keeping the craft element of bourbon making alive, who are willing to experiment and innovate, and who bring passion and personality to an industry that could easily become homogenized and corporate.I left Glenns Creek with a deeper appreciation for the diversity of Kentucky bourbon. The bourbon trail isn't just about visiting famous names – it's about discovering the full spectrum of what bourbon can be.",

      "I left Glenns Creek with a deeper appreciation for the diversity of Kentucky bourbon. The bourbon trail isn't just about visiting famous names – it's about discovering the full spectrum of what bourbon can be.",
      "Six Tips For Your Bourbon Trail Adventure",
      "If I've inspired you to plan your own bourbon trail experience, here's some practical advice to help you navigate it successfully:Book Tours Far in Advance: Popular tours at places like Buffalo Trace, Woodford Reserve, and Maker's Mark can sell out 30-90 days ahead, especially during peak seasons (spring and fall). The special tours, like that Flood Tour I did at Buffalo Trace, fill up almost immediately when new dates are announced. Don't wait until you arrive in Kentucky to book tours – do it when you're planning your trip.Plan Your Route Strategically: The bourbon trail distilleries are concentrated in several geographic clusters. The Bardstown area has multiple distilleries within a few miles of each other. The Lexington/Versailles area that I stayed within has another cluster. Louisville has several urban distilleries. Plan your campground or hotel locations to give you reasonable drives to multiple distilleries, and group your visits geographically to minimize backtracking.Limit Daily Distillery Visits: I learned that two distillery visits per day is really the maximum for enjoying each experience fully, unless you’re within a tour company where someone else is driving you around. Tours typically last 60-90 minutes, and that's before you factor in drive time, gift shop browsing, and any meals. Plus, even though you're only getting small tasting samples at each distillery, that alcohol adds up over the course of a day. Stay safe and stay legal – don't overdo it.Ask About Daily Specials: Most distilleries have rotating special releases and discounts that aren't advertised online. Always ask when you arrive if there are any daily specials or limited releases available. I saved significant money and found bottles I couldn't have gotten anywhere else by asking this simple question.Check Operating Days and Hours: Many distilleries are closed one or two days per week, and those closed days aren't always consistent (some close Mondays and Tuesdays, others close Sundays). I learned this the hard way when I couldn't visit Castle & Key because they were closed. Verify operating days and hours before planning your route.Stay Hydrated and Eat Well: This sounds obvious, but it's easy to forget when you're focused on bourbon tasting. Drink plenty of water between distillery visits, eat substantial meals, and don't try to tough it out if you're feeling the effects of alcohol.",

      "How Much Did My Bourbon Trail Travel Cost?",
      "Let me share some honest talk about costs, because I know many of you are wondering whether a bourbon trail adventure fits your budget.Tour costs varied but were generally reasonable. Most standard distillery tours ranged from $15-25 per person, with premium or specialty tours running $40-75. The tours I chose averaged about $30 each, so four distillery visits cost me roughly $120 in tour fees.Bourbon purchases were my biggest expense, but this was discretionary – you don't have to buy bottles at every distillery, though it's tempting! I spent approximately $400 on bourbon and related products across all four distilleries. That sounds like a lot until you realize that some of these bottles would cost considerably more at home, and several aren't available outside Kentucky at all.Camping costs were minimal thanks to my Thousand Trails membership and AAA discount. Ten nights of camping essentially cost me nothing extra beyond my membership fees, and the additional nights at Kentucky Horse Park were only $45 per night.",

      "Food costs were moderate. I ate most meals at the campground, cooking in my RV, which kept costs low. When I did eat out, like that lunch at Ricardo's, I was looking at $20-30 per meal including tip.Fuel costs varied depending on how much driving I did between distilleries. Planning my route efficiently helped minimize this expense, and using my Jeep (30mpg) to travel instead of my RV (9 mpg) made driving in the steep hills not only more enjoyable, but a lot less expensive.Total costs for a long weekend on bourbon trail : approximately $300 for four days, covering tours, bourbon purchases, a restaurant meal, and campsite expenses. Tips for keeping costs manageable:Book standard tours rather than premium tours if budget is a concernBe selective about bottle purchases – you don't need to buy at every distilleryTake advantage of daily specials and discountsCook most meals at your campground rather than eating outPlan your route efficiently to minimize fuel costsLook for free or low-cost activities between distillery visits",

      "Even as I write this, I'm already thinking my next Kentucky bourbon trail adventure. There's still so much to explore, so many distilleries I didn't visit, so many experiences I want to have.Next time, I want to visit Maker's Mark and see their iconic hand-dipped red wax process. I want to tour Heaven Hill's facilities in Bardstown, the bourbon capital of the world. I want to experience Four Roses' unique approach to bourbon making with their ten different recipes. I want to finally make it to Castle & Key when they're open.I also want to explore more of the craft distillery trail, seeking out those intimate, personality-driven operations that are bringing new energy to Kentucky bourbon. I want to attend the Kentucky Bourbon Festival in Bardstown. I want to time a visit for fall, when the changing leaves make the countryside even more spectacular.But beyond the specific activities, I want to return because Kentucky reminded me why I love this RVing lifestyle. Every destination offers opportunities to learn something new, to challenge yourself, to connect with people and places in meaningful ways. Kentucky delivered on all counts.Have you explored Kentucky's bourbon trail? I'd love to hear about your experiences in thecomments.

LikeWatkins Glen, I could have stayed all day at the falls just taking in the beauty and the majesty of the water and the rock formations.Letchwork State ParkThis is abigpark. About 17 miles from end to end. It took me about 28 minutes to drive from the campground to the Genesee Arch Bridge near the Upper Falls.How long does it take to hike Letchworth?However, don’t let the size of the park discourage you. You can certainly hike the park and see the three main waterfalls in one day.Day 1 - I entered the park at the Mt. Morris, the northernmost entrance. After checking in at Highbanks camping area, I found my campsite, took the dogs for a walk, set up, and then set off in my car to drive the park from one end to the other.There are a lot of stop-off sites with amazing scenic views of the gorge. My favorite one was at Big Bend, where I felt I could see the entire park. It was breathtaking.Letchwork State Park Big Bend OverlookThe day was overcast and misty, creating beautiful, low clouds in the gorge.I also stopped at the Visitor Center for a map and advice. They were so helpful there, and mapped out for me a route to get around the park and see everything, and lessen some of the seven-mile one-way hiking (14 miles total!) between the railroad trestle and the Upper Falls to the Lower Falls.I also got directions on how to get to the nearest gas station from the Visitor Center. Left, right, left … which led me to another beautiful scenic country drive, and a gas station about 20 minutes away from the Portageville Entrance, the southernmost park entrance.Tip- be sure to fill up your tanks before you get to the park. You will be doing a lot of driving and hopping in and out of your car to get to the trails for the falls.While I would have liked to experience Letchworth on a sunny day, both days I was there were overcast and rainy. The tree cover kept me pretty dry, and a lot cooler than an average hot day in July.Bring the proper gear for your hikeYou don’t need a lot, but I would recommend a few things to make your hike more enjoyable.1. Proper hiking shoes. The trails will be wet in spots, and rocky. So it is important to wear shoes with non-slip soles that you will be comfortable in if your feet get wet.My favorite hiking shoe is a hiking sandal. They are the most comfortable hiking shoes I have ever worn. Non-slip, my feet can breathe and expand (as my feet often do as the day goes on), and if my shoes get wet, I don’t have to worry about blisters or wet socks.If you would like to know more about my favorite hiking shoes,message me here.2. Water. I also bring a bottle of water with me, especially on a hot day, although there are plenty of places to buy food and water on the trail.3. A light snack. Another thing I like to carry with me is an Uncrustable, a frozen peanut butter and jelly sandwich that will thaw while you hike, just in case.4. There are plenty of places to use the restroom and grab a bite to eat in the park along the hiking trails.5. Stop at the Visitor Center and grab a map. The ranger highlighted the best route, and it saved me tons of walking, and you might find something else on the map that you want to see.Check out my favorite hiking and camping gearAre pets allowed on the hiking trails?Pets are allowed on the hiking trails, but they need to be kept on a leash no longer than six feet long.I did not bring my dogs on the trails, as I felt a five-to-seven mile hike would not be the best for them. And it was raining, which meant muddy trails, and dogs.There are some areas with flatter walks where I could have taken them back for a walk. But I felt they got enough walking in the campground loops.Is there an entrance fee for Letchwork State Park?There is an entrance fee of $10 per vehicle, unless you are camping in the park. Then your camping pass also serves as your parking pass.In fact, with your camping or parking pass, you can park for “free” at any New York State Park for the duration of your pass!Where should I begin my hike?Day 2 - I drove about a half hour from the campground to the Railroad Trestle/Upper Falls parking area, the beginning of the 7-mile Gorge Trail, which is considered to be the most scenic trail in the park. The Gorge Trail goes through all three main waterfalls, plus some of the other falls that are easier to see in the spring, or after a heavy rainfall.If you are just coming for the day, the Portageville Entrance is the one closest to the beginning of the trail.It’s an easy place to pass by, and circle back to. When you see a turn near the Railroad Trestle, that’s the parking area.From here, I walked down the 237 stairs to where I could see the top of the Upper Waterfall.Then I continued down the #1 Gorge trail, clearly marked in pink, where I was able to view the Upper Falls and the Railroad Trestle Bridge (still functioning), from the bottom.The Upper Falls is about 70 feet high and 300 feet wide.Letchworth State Park Upper Falls and Railroad TrestleTip- Because the trains still run over the Railroad Trestle Bridge, you may be lucky enough to see a train as it crosses over the 675-foot long bridge 234 feet above the Genesee River.I decided to continue on the Gorge trail, headed towards the Middle Falls.You really get a great view of the Gorge and the rock formations from the Middle Falls. Middle Falls is 107-feet high and about 285-feet wide.Letchwork State Park Middle FallsNext I walked back to the top of the #1 Gorge Trail, and back up the 237 steps to my car.This portion of the hike took me about an hour, even though the total hike is only about a mile. I took my time and spent a lot of time appreciating the beauty of both falls.After eating my favorite hiking snack, an Uncrustables, in my car, I drove a few miles down the road to Lower Falls and Rafting Rec area, where you could catch a bus for a white-water rafting excursion.Hopping back on the #1 Gorge Trails, I walked about 10 minutes and another 127 steps down to the Lower Falls, which I think were my favorite falls.Lower Falls is approximately 55-feet high and 150-feet wide.Letchworth State Park Lower FallsFrom here, you could also walk across the footbridge to the other side of the Gorge, to experience more spectacular gorge views and to see the Sugarloaf rock formation.Letchworth State Park Sugar Loaf or Cathedral RockTo reach the footbridge, I had to cross a very muddy area. In one place my whole foot sunk in. The foot bridge itself was also very wet. On a good note, I was able to find a small stream on my way back up to my car, where I took my shoe off and washed it out, and got the mud off my foot.Now you can see why I like my hiking sandals.It took me about another hour, with 127 steps downs and back, to complete this part of the hike.Click here to watch a short video about my day at Letchworth State Park.What else can I do at Letchworth State Park?As I mentioned before, you can also do awhite-water rafting excursion, and, weather permitting, ahot air balloon excursion. Sadly, there were no balloons on the days I was there.I decided to go and check out the Mt. Morris Dam, near the Mt. Morris entrance not far from the Highbanks CampGround.The Mt. Morris Dam is a 230-foot high, 1,000 foot plus structure made of concrete and steel, with more than a mile's worth of tunnels in the structure, designed to prevent devastating floods and protect residents and property along the Genesee River.1When I was here, the river bed was dry. However, at times the water can rise almost to the top of the dam, and create a 200-foot deep lake, backing up as far as 17-miles.Mt. Morris DamIs there any wildlife on the Gorge Trail?I didn’t see anything other than turkey vultures; however, people have reported seeing deer, chipmunks, and even bears.Check out the reports at the Visitor Center, where they have a book where people can log their wildlife sightings.Where can you stay in Letchworth State Park?I stayed at the campground located right in Letchworth, Highbanks Campground.Highbanks Campground at Letchworth State ParkThere are eight loops to choose from, but not all of them are pet-friendly. Some loops are more rustic than others, no electricity, so be sure to read the fine print about your site before making your reservation.Book your campsite as far in advance as possible. They allow up to nine months in advance. I had no trouble finding a site four months in advance, but there was no additional availability during my stay.There was a 2-night minimum in all of the New York State Parks that I stayed in.If you have dogs, be sure to bring copies of their recent rabies certificates, with the expiration date (not the metal tags).The site I was on had electric, but no water or sewer. There was a dump station and a place to fill your tanks with potable water.The sites were large and fairly spread out, and I had plenty of room to unhook and store my tow dolly. They have a great camp store where you can get firewood and other camping related items, as well as a big laundry room.The roads in each of the loops were gravel from what I could see, but I did not explore every loop.There is also a large pool, the Harvey Pool near the Mt. Morris Dam and Recreation Area, near the Mt. Morris entrance to the park, which is open to anyone with a parking pass.I haven’t seen many state parks with pools, but it’s a thing at some New York State parks!Plan your next road trip! Get RV-friendly GPS, share your trip with friends and family.Is Letchworth State Park worth going to?YES! The hike is so beautiful and enjoyable, and the Gorge is awe-inspiring.The parking is semi RV-friendly, including the parking at the Visitor Center. However, for ease of getting around the park and exploring, I would recommend having a car with you, as the roads are a bit twisty.1https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/rochester/news/2023/06/29/army-corps-of-engineers-begins-tunnel-repairs-at-mount-morris-damIf you have any comments, suggestions or questions about Letchworth State Park, or if you would like to know when I publish a new article,you can message me here.Thanks for joining me as I continue Year 2 of this full-time RV life.Subscribe below for updates as we travel and continue to enjoy and learn more about life on the road.Click on the above phototo watch a quick video about Letchworth State Park!Your privacy is important to us, and we do not share your information.

When you see a turn near the Railroad Trestle, that’s the parking area.From here, I walked down the 237 stairs to where I could see the top of the Upper Waterfall.Then I continued down the #1 Gorge trail, clearly marked in pink, where I was able to view the Upper Falls and the Railroad Trestle Bridge (still functioning), from the bottom.The Upper Falls is about 70 feet high and 300 feet wide.",

We will make a commission when you make a purchase at no cost to you, but it helps me buy gas ⛽️ for my travels! Thanks for your support.Updated September 2025Camping is expensive, right?  Even state park campgrounds on the east coast run about $50+ a night, and many other campgrounds are closer to $100 a night.Using $50 a night as a low average, the cost to live in my RV for a month would be at least $1,500 a month. Not including the cost of diesel, tolls, and repairs.  Maybe this full-time RV life wasn’t going to be such a great idea.In myStarting My Full-Time Adventure blog post, I left one thing out.  How would I be able to afford to pay for a place to sleep every night?I had heard about Thousand Trails, looked into it, and decided to buy a Southeast Zone pass (currently $755 for one year) with the Trails Collection option (+$450).  This gave me over 20 campgrounds in the Southeast that I could camp “for free”, or just the cost of the yearly dues.  Adding the Trails Collection added over 100 campgrounds, all over the country.  Total cost for the year is $1,205.You can add additional zones around the US for $125 per zone.The Zone passdoeshave limitations, and it gets confusing very quickly. Basically, you can stay for 14 days in a park, then you have to leave the system for 7 days.You can make your reservations up to 60 days in advance, which sometimes makes it challenging to get into the park you want.So, with the Thousand Trails Zone Pass and Trails Collective, I had a place to stay for up to 3 weeks a month.  But what about the 4th week? It was still going to cost me over $350, and a lot of headaches trying to find other campsites.Itcanbe confusing, but if you keep track of your booking window, and book as soon as your are able to, you will have more sites available to book.Or I can help you get the best deals on the available Thousand Trails Camping Pass and Membership programs.Learn more hereI have found the best way to use the program is to plan your travels and adventures as far in advance as you can.Last year I found this pretty easy, as I knew the exact start date of my trip.I did have a change of plans half way through my trip last year, but it was very easy to make the changes through Thousand Trails. Even when it was a short notice change due to bad weather.Thousand Trails was amazing and able to book me earlier into a safer campground. You canread more about some of the changes I had to make here.Thousand Trails Adventure Membership with Trails Collection PlusI spoke to a Membership Specialist, who explained the Membership packages and prices.My first thought was, “this is ridiculously expensive”.But after sleeping on it and crunching some numbers, based on the low-ball amount of $50 a night in camping fees, it would cost me over $18,000 to camp every night for one year.While some campgrounds around the country are starting to charge extra for electric, Thousand Trails includes all of my electricity, water, and waste management as well.And suddenly the Adventure Membership didn’t seem so ridiculously priced.  Honestly, it would pay for itself in about three months.Andthere were so many other benefits.The 3 Biggest Reasons I Decided to Buy a Thousand Trails Adventure Membership with Trails Collection Plus.I can stay up to 21-nights in any Thousand Trails or Encore park across the country. Currently there are are almost 200 campgrounds in the system, with 40 of them being in Florida (where I love to spend the winter!), with a 180-day booking window in the Thousand Trails parks.I can travel from park-to-park-to-park in either Thousand Trails or Encore campgrounds.I can book up to 180 days  in advance for Thousand Trails or up to 90 days in advance for Encore through theincludedTrails Collection Plus program, only available to Adventure Members.Some of the other benefits of the Adventure Membership are:Free RPI for one year - RPI is an affiliate of Thousand Trails and offer parks for as little as $10 per night. These campgrounds help to fill the gaps in the mid states.Cabin Rebate Stays - one week per year.Get Away Cabin Stays - one week per year, which you can trade in towards a condo or a cruise.Family BenefitsFour non high-use weeks per year at $29 per week and two high-use weeks per year at $99 per week.How much does an Adventure Membership cost?$8000 for a 2-year membership, or $900 down and $295 per month$14,400 for a 4-year membership,or $1500 down and $269 per month)INTEREST FREE AND NO ANNUAL DUES!Byworking directly with a Membership Specialist, I was able to save money off the original cost of the package.Check out the Newest Thousand Trails Membership Plan - Explorer.Stay up to 21-nights in any Thousand Trails, with a 150-day booking window in the Thousand Trails parks.Travel from park-to-park-to-park in all 82 Thousand Trails campgrounds.It includes Trails Collection program, giving you another 120+ parks to stay in.The difference between the Trails Collection Plus and the Trails Collection is the booking window time and the amount of time you can stay.The Trails Collection Plus,available only with the Adventure Membership,has a booking window of90days, and the Trails Collection has a booking window of60days.With the Trails Collection, you can stay up to 14-days. After that, you can go directly to a Thousand Trails Park, but you can only return to a Trails Collection Park after being out of the Trail Collection System for seven days.With the Trails Collection Plus, you can stay up to 21-days. After that, you can go directly to either a Thousand Trails or an Encore Park.Some of the other benefits of the Explorer Membership are:Free RPI for one year - RPI is an affiliate of Thousand Trails and offer parks for as little as $10 per night. These campgrounds help to fill the gaps in the mid states.Cabin Rebate Stays - one week per year.Get Away Cabin Stays - one week per year, which you can trade in towards a condo or a cruise.Family BenefitsTwo non high-use weeks per year at $29 per week so you can actually stay four weeks in one park, if you want.How much does an Explorer Membership cost?$6000 for a 2-year membership, or $700 down and $220 per month$10,800 for a 4-year membership, or $1100 down and $202 per monthINTEREST FREE AND NO ANNUAL DUES!Byworking directly with a Membership Specialist, I was able to save money off the original cost of the package.Thousand Trails Membership Plan - Journey.Stay up to 21-nights in any Thousand Trails.  with a 120-day booking window in the Thousand Trails parks.Travel from park-to-park-to-park in all 82 Thousand Trails campgrounds.It includes Trails Collection program, giving you another 120+ parks to stay in.Some of the other benefits of the Journey Membership are:Free RPI for one year - RPI is an affiliate of Thousand Trails and offer parks for as little as $10 per night. These campgrounds help to fill the gaps in the mid states.Cabin Rebate Stays - one week per year.Family BenefitsTwo non high-use weeks per year at $29 per week so you can actually stay four weeks in one park, if you want.How much does a Journey Membership cost?$4000 for a 2-year membership, or $500 down and $146 per month$7200 for a 4-year membership, or $700 down and $136 per monthINTEREST FREE AND NO ANNUAL DUES!Byworking directly with a Membership Specialist, I was able to save money off the original cost of the package.Does Thousand Trails Work All the Time?If I decided to stay in their network every night, yes it would.However, there are places that I went and that I want to go that are not near a Thousand Trails or Encore park.Either there aren’t Thousand Trails/Encore parks where I am going,orthere was a specific park I wanted to stay in, like the one on the beach inAssateague National Seashore, or in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan or in Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota.Many of the campgrounds within the system are located on the east and west coasts. So when I travel to many of the national parks in the midwest, I will be paying for places to stay, or I can look for available RPI campgrounds that average $10 a night.When I firstplan out a trip, I always look for the Thousand Trails/Encore parks along the route first.  Then I fill in with state parks, andHarvest Hosts.**UPDATEState Parks have become a LOT more expensive - more expensive than the $30 a night I would spend in aHarvest Hostlocation. So now my planning is Thousand Trails/Encore, Harvest Hosts, state parks.You cansave 15% off your Harvest Hosts Membership by clicking here.In 2023, with the 40 campsites I chose to stay in, 14 of them were Thousand Trails or Encore campgrounds.  Overall I spent about 188 nights at a Thousand Trails/Encore campground, and I wasn’t even “full-time” until May!Most years I think I will end up spending about 300 nights within the Thousand Trails system.My guestimate is that I will spend less than $2,500 on all of the campgrounds for the year, saving money by staying in Thousand Trails/Encore parks whenever possible.What Are Thousand Trails/Encore Campgrounds Like?Every campground was different.  I felt very safe in every place I stayed. Most were gated and required a code to get in.Many parks have planned activities and fun things to do, including pools, lakes, even golf courses, as well as access to camp stores, laundry facilities, bathrooms, and hot showers.  Most offer full hook ups, including electricity and water. Some have dump access right at your campsite. All of the ones I have stayed at offer dump stations.  All included in your campsite admission.It’s easy to meet people, if you want, and easy to make friends that you will continue to see, as many of Thousand Trails members \"bounce\" around from park-to-park across the country.I haven’t had any problem reserving the campgrounds I want, when I want them.  An advantage of a longer booking window that comes with the Adventure Membership.I could have chosen a membership with shorter reservation booking windows and without the Trails Collection Plus. But as someone who was planning on using this program for at least the next 5 years as I travel the country in my RV full-time, it’s a no-brainer to have the largest booking window with the longest stays available to me.Get out and camp! Let me help you get the best deal on a Thousand Trails Camping Pass or Membership.Learn moreWhat’s It Like Having to Move Every Two or Three Weeks?This is my first year staying in the system.  You canread more about staying at Thousand Trails/Encore parks in Florida in the winter here.But, moving every few weeks to stay somewhere for “free” is a good thing for me.  I like the ability to stay in different places and see different people, and it helps me to keep my personal belongings in check, as I have to pack them up every so often and move.Is this life for everyone? No, I don’t think it is.Does it work for me right now? Absolutely!How much is a Thousand Trails Annual Site?You can also get for an annual site.This means that it is your site for the year, and you can come and go as you please.There are different site tiers, like regular and premium sites, and each Thousand Trails park charges different prices.Once you find a Thousand Trails Park you like that you may want to get an annual site, contact that park directly to see what is available and how much an annual site costs. From my experience, an annual site can range from $8,000 to $12,000 a year.Thanks for joining me as I learn more about this full-time RV life.If you have any questions about the Thousand Trails system or would like to leave a comment,click here.Subscribe below for updates as we travel.Your privacy is important to us, and we do not share your information.

So when I travel to many of the national parks in the midwest, I will be paying for places to stay, or I can look for available RPI campgrounds that average $10 a night.When I firstplan out a trip, I always look for the Thousand Trails/Encore parks along the route first.

So now my planning is Thousand Trails/Encore, Harvest Hosts, state parks.You cansave 15% off your Harvest Hosts Membership by clicking here.In 2023, with the 40 campsites I chose to stay in, 14 of them were Thousand Trails or Encore campgrounds.  Overall I spent about 188 nights at a Thousand Trails/Encore campground, and I wasn’t even “full-time” until May!Most years I think I will end up spending about 300 nights within the Thousand Trails system.My guestimate is that I will spend less than $2,500 on all of the campgrounds for the year, saving money by staying in Thousand Trails/Encore parks whenever possible.What Are Thousand Trails/Encore Campgrounds Like?Every campground was different.  I felt very safe in every place I stayed. Most were gated and required a code to get in.Many parks have planned activities and fun things to do, including pools, lakes, even golf courses, as well as access to camp stores, laundry facilities, bathrooms, and hot showers.  Most offer full hook ups, including electricity and water. Some have dump access right at your campsite. All of the ones I have stayed at offer dump stations.  All included in your campsite admission.It’s easy to meet people, if you want, and easy to make friends that you will continue to see, as many of Thousand Trails members \"bounce\" around from park-to-park across the country.I haven’t had any problem reserving the campgrounds I want, when I want them.  An advantage of a longer booking window that comes with the Adventure Membership.I could have chosen a membership with shorter reservation booking windows and without the Trails Collection Plus. But as someone who was planning on using this program for at least the next 5 years as I travel the country in my RV full-time, it’s a no-brainer to have the largest booking window with the longest stays available to me.",

      "Skip to contentMaking My Own LaneHomeYou TubeRV Budget WorksheetThousand TrailsGift IdeasRV Living ResourcesBlogWork With MeContact meContact meLithium Ion Battery and Power Charging Station ReviewWritten by Nancy Carter of Making My Own LaneThis article contains affiliate links. We will make a commission when you make a purchase at no cost to you, but it helps me buy gas ⛽️ for my travels! Thanks for your support.Today I'm diving into a hands-on review of the Dr. Prepare Promax Lithium Ion Battery and MaxHub Power Charging Station. It’s a powerhouse solution for camping, emergency backups, and off-grid adventures that costs a lot less than the competition and is UL approved!For the past few weeks, I've really put this to the test and I'll walk you through the features, the performance, and whether or not it's worth your hard-earned money.Dr. Prepare emailed me and asked me to review about how this lithium ion battery and power charging station would fit into the RV lifestyle. Since I had already purchased another Dr. Prepare,  I am excited to be able to testthisproduct out for you.It took about 4 days from the time I ordered it until the time I received it. I'll give you more of the specs later as we get into the actual product review.Everything comes very neatly packed in a heavy duty cardboard box to protect it.What comes in the package:First there's the user guide.It comes with a metal plate, if you want to more permanently install this in your RV so it doesn't shift around during travel.Next is the battery. It has two carry straps. It weighs about 25 lbs, and the carry straps make it very easy to move it around.It is a 100 amp hour lithium ion battery to provide a lot of charging time for things in your RV.In a separate package, I received the battery charging hub. It clicks right onto the top of the battery. I also received a 12 volt adapter adapter.Description:The Dr. Prepare Promax is a two-in-one power station that combines a 12 volt, 100 amp hour LiFePO4 battery with a 1280Wh hour portable solar generator.The MaxHub recharging power station snaps on to the top of the battery and has a built-in Anderson port with an MP PPT and a USBC port with a maximum output of 100 watts.Uses:I feel that this would be a great battery to be able to carry in my car while I'm traveling. If I'm filming and my camera dies, it can be challenging to find power, unless I want to sit there and run my car to charge things. This way I can charge my phone up or my camera and microphone up while I'm traveling. So when I get where I need to go, everything I need for my adventure is charged up.One of the best things about my RV lifestyle is that I can work from anywhere, especially outside. And this power pack will allow me to do that for extended periods of time, no matter where I am - whether I'm at the  campground or at the beach.I was even able to hook my air compressor up to the battery. I was able to use the inflator, which will allow me to inflate my paddle board wherever I go!Another thing I was able to do was run the air compressor off the Dr. Prepare battery so that I can check my tire pressure, or even inflate a tire on my RV or car in an emergency.Being able to Dr. Prepare ProMax battery and MaxHub power station to inflate my paddleboard and RV or car tires make this extremely valuable to me.What Ididn'tsee was a place to plug a standard plug into, but I was able to use the included 12 volt adapter and plug that into a power inverter I already own. Mine is a 300 watt with a 600 watt maximum outlet, but it allowed me to charge my computer. With my inverter, I can actually plug two plugs into it.There are times when I'm boondocking that I need to charge things up and I just don't have enough plugs, or I don't want to waste the power from my RV solar batteries, especially if it's raining.It's nice to know that if the power goes out, I can still charge my computer or run a small light or charge my phone.How long did the power last without a recharge?I tried charging my phone, my ipad, and my flashlights for several days, trying to get the battery to go down, and the battery power just wouldn’t go lower.I finally tried running the power strip that powers the back room of my RV, including a TV, a light and a phone charger. I ran in through the Dr. Prepare ProMax and MaxHub charging station for about 2 hours, with the TV on, and this did bring the charge on the battery down about one bar.Pros:Weighing 25 lbs with two carry strap handles, it's still lightweight enough for you to take it with you in your car and use it to charge up multiple electronics at one time, like your phone and your cameras or even an air compressor for your inflatable paddle boards or kayaks.It has solar charging capabilities.Andit's very quiet, even when you're recharging it.Cons:You do have to purchase a wall charger separately, for faster charging of the battery station, although you can charge it with a USB cord.I would definitely purchase the wall charger.The other con is that if you want to use this for anything that takes a normal plug, like a refrigerator, a TV, a computer, or even some medical devices -  anything that plugs in with a traditional wall outlet, you will need to buy a separate inverter.Another pro, however, is the price point. Even with adding on the cost of the charger and a separate inverter, this power station is still less than a third of the other 100 watt hour battery charging stations available.It's great for powering up phones, cameras, lights, CPAP machines and even your computer, tablet, or a TV.And Dr Prepare was kind enough to allow me to offer you an extra 10% off your purchase with coupon codeBATTERY10, just for reading this review.Learn moreMy Final Verdict:Overall, I've been really impressed with the Dr Prepare Promax and MaxHub Charging Station.It's reliable, compact, and for about $162 delivered, it's a great buy. Especially if you want flexibility without going into full-on generator mode.It's also an affiliate link which means that I will earn a small commission on each sale at no additional cost to you and it really helps me to stay on the road and keep on bringing you more RV life content.I've got more RV life gear reviews coming for you soon.You canwatch my YouTube video review here!Thanks for joining me as I learn more about this full-time RV life.If you have any questions about the Dr. Prepare Promax Lithium Ion Battery and MaxHub Power Charging Station, or would like to leave a comment,click here.Subscribe below for updates as we travel.Your privacy is important to us, and we do not share your information.

      "The other con is that if you want to use this for anything that takes a normal plug, like a refrigerator, a TV, a computer, or even some medical devices -  anything that plugs in with a traditional wall outlet, you will need to buy a separate inverter.",
      "Another pro, however, is the price point. Even with adding on the cost of the charger and a separate inverter, this power station is still less than a third of the other 100 watt hour battery charging stations available.",
      "It's great for powering up phones, cameras, lights, CPAP machines and even your computer, tablet, or a TV.",
      "And Dr Prepare was kind enough to allow me to offer you an extra 10% off your purchase with coupon codeBATTERY10, just for reading this review.",
      "My Final Verdict:Overall, I've been really impressed with the Dr Prepare Promax and MaxHub Charging Station.It's reliable, compact, and for about $162 delivered, it's a great buy.

Please see our full disclosurefor more information.Watkins Glen is a state park in the New York Finger Lakes region located in Watkins Glen, NY, about one and a half hours south of Rochester.The park itself is less than two square miles, but don’t let that fool you.The 19 waterfalls and 400-foot deep gorge are spectacular.And yes, this can be a challenging hike, with many steps to get up into the falls area.However, there is an easier way, and a harder way. Let me share with you the easier way, some of the amazing sights you will experience along your path, and a few tips that will make your day much more enjoyable.How long does it take to hike Watkins Glen?You can hike the main Gorge Trail, where you will see all 19 of the waterfalls and sights in less than two hours. Even if you stop to take lots of pictures, like I did.It’s 1.5 miles long.I recommend getting there in the morning, no later than 10 am or so. This will help you to beat the crowds, and avoid the hottest part of the day.I did this hike in July, and it was hot, but the waterfalls and tree cover along the way help to keep you a little cooler.Bring the proper gear for your hikeYou don’t need a lot, but I would recommend a few things to make your hike more enjoyable.1. Proper hiking shoes. The trails will be wet in spots, and rocky. So it is important to wear shoes with non-slip soles that you will be comfortable in if your feet get wet.My favorite hiking shoe is a hiking sandal. They are the most comfortable hiking shoes I have ever worn. Non-slip, my feet can breathe and expand (as my feet often do as the day goes on), and if my shoes get wet, I don’t have to worry about blisters or wet socks.If you would like to know more about my favorite hiking shoes,click here to check them out.I earn a small commission if you click this link and make a purchase, at no additional cost to you.2. Water. I also bring a bottle of water with me, especially on a hot day. There isn’t anywhere to buy food or water on the trail.3. A light snack. Another thing I like to carry with me is an Uncrustable, a frozen peanut butter and jelly sandwich that will thaw while you hike.Sometimes I eat it for lunch, and sometimes just a snack. Even on shorter hikes, there are many times I was happy just to sit for a minute and eat a quick bite.4. Use the bathroom before you start. There are three entrances to the trail. The Upper Entrance, The Main Entrance, and the South Entrance.All of the entrances have bathrooms and a snack shack of sorts. The Main Entrance is the one right on Franklin Street where the Visitor Center is.5. Grab a map. It’s hard to get lost on this trail, but you might see something else on the map that you want to see.You can find my hiking sandals and other outdoor items in the Amazon ShopAre pets allowed on the trails?Pets are not allowed on the Gorge Trail, but you can bring them on the North or South Rim trails.Is there an entrance fee for Watkins Glen State Park?If you enter on foot, it’s free. If you have to park your car or RV, it will cost you $10, unless you are camping in the park. Then your camping pass also serves as your parking pass.In fact, with your camping or parking pass, you can park for “free” at any New York State Park for the duration of your pass!Where should I begin my hike?The Gorge Trail is the main trail through the park. There are also the North Rim Trail and the South Ridge Trail, which I did spend a little bit of time on because I wanted to walk over the suspension bridge, not just under it. I have this thing for walking over tall bridges. (link)If you look at the way the points of interest on their map are numbered, 1 to 12, it seems like the best place to start is the main entrance.However, if you start at the main entrance, you will find your hike will be mostly uphill, with an elevation gain of about 550 feet.After studying the map, I decided to park at the Upper Entrance and hike “downhill”, starting with the 180 steps that make up Jacob’s Ladder.The top of Jacob's Ladder at Watkins Glen State ParkTo me, down is better than up.What are some of the things I will see on your hike?After you walk down the Jacob’s ladder staircase,  you will walk about a half a mile before you come to the Mile-Point Bridge. Once you walk under the bridge, turn around and look at this spectacular view.Watkins Glen State Park Mile-Point BridgeIn fact, keep turning around throughout the entire hike and take it all it. If you just look at what’s in front of you, you will miss so much.Continuing on, you will see Frowning Cliff, Rainbow Falls, Central Cascade (the highest waterfall at 60 feet), Glen Cathedral, and Lover’s Lane Lookout.Watkins Glen Central CascadeYou will then pass under the suspension bridge to Cavern Cascade, where you get to walk behind a waterfall.Watkins Glen Cavern CascadeNext is Point Lookout, Couches Staircase (120 steps up), and the Sentry Bridge.Or, at Point Lookout I decided to go up some steps (not the 120 at Couches Staircase) on to the North Ridge Trail, over the suspension bridge for a great view 85 feet above the creek.Watkins Glen suspension bridgeI then continued down the South Rim trail, which literally brings you to a road, Route 329, and you can walk a short distance back to the Main Entrance and check out the Visitor Center.I was glad I took the easier route, as I had a lot more steps I would be doing at my next stop at Letchworth State Park, also in New York!How do you get back to where you started?You can hike another mile and a half back uphill on the trail to your car.Oryou can do what I did, cross the street at the main entrance, pay $6 and take the Watkins Glen Park shuttle back to your car. You can pay with exact change cash, or use the QR code on a sign at the front of the bus to pay with your phone.There were people (locals) on the bus who had parked at the main entrance and were taking the bus to the Upper Entrance to begin their hike from there.The entire trip, from beginning to end, took me about two hours.When your roadside assistance just isn't coming through for you, check outRV Help. It's like having your own RV Tech along to the ride!Where did I stay in Watkins Glen?I stayed at the campground located right in Watkins Glen State Park!There are six “villages” or loops to choose from.Be sure to book your campsite as far in advance as possible. They allow up to nine months in advance, but I had no trouble finding a site four months in advance.If you have dogs, be sure to brings copies of their recent rabies certificates, with the expiration date (not the metal tags).The site I was on had electric, no water and no sewer, but there was a dump station and a place to fill your tanks with potable water.The sites were large and fairly spread out, and I had plenty of room to unhook and store my tow dolly. They have a great camp store where you can get firewood and other camping related items.The roads in each of the villages were paved, giving you a great place to ride bikes.Watkins Glen State Park campingThey also had a large pool, which was open to anyone with a parking pass.I haven’t seen many state parks with pools, but it’s a thing in New York!Is Watkins Glen State Park worth going to?YES! The hike is so beautiful and enjoyable, and the Gorge is awe-inspiring.The parking is RV-friendly, whether you park at the Main Entrance across the street from the visitor center or at the Upper Entrance.Click above to watch a short video about my day at Watkins Glen State Park.If you have any comments, suggestions or questions about Watkins Glen State Park, or if you would like to know when I publish a new article,you can message me here.Thanks for joining me as I continue Year 2 of this full-time RV life.Subscribe below for updates as we travel and continue to enjoy and learn more about life on the road.Your privacy is important to us, and we do not share your information.

      "Watkins Glen is a state park in the New York Finger Lakes region located in Watkins Glen, NY, about one and a half hours south of Rochester.The park itself is less than two square miles, but don’t let that fool you.The 19 waterfalls and 400-foot deep gorge are spectacular.",

      "The 19 waterfalls and 400-foot deep gorge are spectacular.",
      "And yes, this can be a challenging hike, with many steps to get up into the falls area.However, there is an easier way, and a harder way. Let me share with you the easier way, some of the amazing sights you will experience along your path, and a few tips that will make your day much more enjoyable.",

      "How long does it take to hike Watkins Glen?You can hike the main Gorge Trail, where you will see all 19 of the waterfalls and sights in less than two hours. Even if you stop to take lots of pictures, like I did.It’s 1.5 miles long.I recommend getting there in the morning, no later than 10 am or so. This will help you to beat the crowds, and avoid the hottest part of the day.I did this hike in July, and it was hot, but the waterfalls and tree cover along the way help to keep you a little cooler.",

      "Bring the proper gear for your hikeYou don’t need a lot, but I would recommend a few things to make your hike more enjoyable.1. Proper hiking shoes. The trails will be wet in spots, and rocky. So it is important to wear shoes with non-slip soles that you will be comfortable in if your feet get wet.My favorite hiking shoe is a hiking sandal. They are the most comfortable hiking shoes I have ever worn. Non-slip, my feet can breathe and expand (as my feet often do as the day goes on), and if my shoes get wet, I don’t have to worry about blisters or wet socks.If you would like to know more about my favorite hiking shoes,click here to check them out.I earn a small commission if you click this link and make a purchase, at no additional cost to you.2. Water. I also bring a bottle of water with me, especially on a hot day. There isn’t anywhere to buy food or water on the trail.3. A light snack. Another thing I like to carry with me is an Uncrustable, a frozen peanut butter and jelly sandwich that will thaw while you hike.Sometimes I eat it for lunch, and sometimes just a snack. Even on shorter hikes, there are many times I was happy just to sit for a minute and eat a quick bite.4. Use the bathroom before you start. There are three entrances to the trail. The Upper Entrance, The Main Entrance, and the South Entrance.All of the entrances have bathrooms and a snack shack of sorts. The Main Entrance is the one right on Franklin Street where the Visitor Center is.5. Grab a map. It’s hard to get lost on this trail, but you might see something else on the map that you want to see.",

      "Where should I begin my hike?The Gorge Trail is the main trail through the park. There are also the North Rim Trail and the South Ridge Trail, which I did spend a little bit of time on because I wanted to walk over the suspension bridge, not just under it. I have this thing for walking over tall bridges. (link)If you look at the way the points of interest on their map are numbered, 1 to 12, it seems like the best place to start is the main entrance.However, if you start at the main entrance, you will find your hike will be mostly uphill, with an elevation gain of about 550 feet.After studying the map, I decided to park at the Upper Entrance and hike “downhill”, starting with the 180 steps that make up Jacob’s Ladder.",

At the same time, it does fall under the National Park Pass that I will talk more about a little later.Also, if you download theNPS app, you can find guided audio tours and the history of the park, and all the parks that fall under “National Park” status, even if they aren’t officially National Parks.For some reason, I only allowed myself 24 hours at Sleeping Bear Dunes.Actually more like 18 hours, after I checked in and got my bearings.I checked into the campground, set up my site, and headed out to explore around 6 pm.When visiting the dunes in the summer, it will stay light out until almost 9:30 pm, so I had 3 hours to hike.The park ranger had recommended that I head north from Platte River Campground, a National Lakeshore Campground, toPierce Stocking Scenic DriveThe drive is a 7.4 mile loop with 12 numbered points of interest.Hint - Download the NPS app and pull up Sleeping Bear Dunes for a guided, narrated tour as you get to each stop.At the Number 9 stop of the Scenic Drive, you will find the 284-foot, 45 degree world famous Dune Drop down soft, white sand. It is about the equivalent of an 11-story building.From the top of the highest dune it is 450-feet down to Lake Michigan; however the place most people start their decline is at the 284-foot mark.There is a sign clearly stating the $3,000 fineif you run down to the bottom and need to be rescued to get back up. Although I did see one group of people run down to an awaiting boat, and completely avoid the climb back to the top. It almost felt like they were cheating 😂.This is the one most popular hike that you see on social media all the time that some people climb for fun.You can also explore the dunes from the top, where there is a wooden observation deck, and some hiking trails for a beautiful view of Glen Lake, and more dunes you can climb to the top of.Hint - If you’re not sure about attempting the hike down to Lake Michigan, and back up, try climbing these dunes first to see how you do.I found it pretty strenuous climbing in the soft sand and it solidified my decision to NOT attempt the big dune drop.The evening I was there in early August was not crowded.I did stay and watch some people to see how long the hike took, and I timed them at 45 minutes. But I’ve also heard that the average time is a little over an hour, with some people taking as long as 3 hours.Pets are not allowed on the dunes.Next I drove south, back towards the campground, toEmpire Bluff TrailAnother ranger recommendation. I always ask the rangers, either at the campground check in area or at the Visitor's Center, where the best places are to go. Especially if I am limited on time, like on this one-night stop.The trail is about 1.5 miles, and it leads to an overlook where you can admire the entirety of the dunes, and watch an amazing sunset.You can bring your dog, as long as they are on a leash no longer than six feet, but remember it is a three-mile hike total, if you have a short-nose, small dog with less stamina, like Willie.After walking for about 30 minutes, I almost turned around. It was getting dark and I wasn’t sure what I would even find at the end. So I checked my Waze, and saw I was at least on the right trail, and I kept on going. I'm so glad I did.There were benches to sit on, and it seemed to be a very popular place to watch the sunset.As a solo traveler, I appreciated this because it meant I had people to walk with on the 1.5 miles back to my car, in semi-darkness after the official setting of the sun.The total hike, and sunset watching, took about an hour and a half.The next morning, I decided to do one more hike before I left.Platte River Campground to Lake Michigan via Railroad GradeThis was a 2.5 mile hike from the campground parking lot. My site was in Loop 1, the farthest from the lot, but a loop that had electric hookups.So for me, it was about a 3.5 mile hike.The hike was very wooded and flat most of the way. The mosquitoes and biting flies were making me wish I had brought bug spray.The last half mile or so I found myself back in soft, deep, white sand which was more strenuous to walk through.The hike one way took about 45-minutes, and I almost turned back because I had to check out and move on that day. I've had a lot of those situations lately, where I was almost ready to turn back.And again, I would have missed so much.After looking on Waze again to see how much farther away Lake Michigan was, I kept on going, and found myself the only person on the most beautiful beach I have ever been on.The beach was natural and pristine, and the water super clear (and cold for this Florida girl).I sat down at the water’s edge for a while, just to take in the beauty of the location and celebrate sticking my toes in Lake Michigan, my fifth Great Lake, before heading backPets were not allowed on the beach part of this trail. There were signs when you got to to the sandy part to remind you, no dogs allowed.Are pets allowed on the trails?Pets are not allowed on the Dune Climb trail and many of the beaches. In the areas they are allowed, they need to be kept on a leash no longer than six feet long.Be sure to check the rules for your hike before you start so that you are able to complete your hike and see all the beauty of this park.Is there an entrance fee for Sleeping Bear Dunes National Park?There is a $25 vehicle pass needed to access and park within the park. You can purchase a pass at the Phillip A. Hart Visitor Center, The Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive, the Dune Climb, the Homestead, or at the ranger office if you are staying in the campground.Hint - if you will be visiting more National Parks in a one-year period, you can purchase a yearlyNational Parks America the Beautiful passfor $80 at the above location.I was thrilled to be able to purchase my Silver National Parks pass this year! When you turn 62, you can purchase this pass for $80 and it is good for the rest of your life! Just don't lose it, or you will have to buy a new one.My birthday was the day I chose to visit Sleeping Bear Dunes, so I was able to purchase my Lifetime Silver pass right at the campground.Bring the proper gear for your hikeYou don’t need a lot, but I would recommend a few things to make your hikes in Sleeping Bear Dunes more enjoyable.1.  Proper hiking shoes. The trails can be wet and muddy in spots, and sandy. Wearing shoes with non-slip soles helps if your feet get wet, but I did just end up taking my shoes off in the dunes.My favorite hiking shoe is a hiking sandal, that lets my feet breath and expand, as my feet often do as the day goes on.If you would like to know more about my hiking sandals,message me here.2.  Water. It’s always worth having a bottle of water with you, even for a short hike.  You never know.3.  A light snack. I usually carry an Uncrustable frozen peanut butter and jelly sandwich with me. Sometimes you can find a wheat bread version. It gives you an extra jolt of protein to keep going, and it’s easy to carry.4.  Use the bathroom before you start your hike. There are facilities at the beginning of the hikes I talk about today.5.  Bring your cell phone. Even when service was limited or non-existent, like many national parks, I was able to access my route on Waze.6.  Bug spray. The hike from the Platte River Campground to Lake Michigan had so many mosquitoes in the wooded part of the hike. Idid nothave bug spray with me, but I really wish that I did. Now I just keep a bottle in my hiking backpack, just in case.The Legend of Manitou Islands and the Sleeping Bear“Once, long ago, in the land called Wisconsin across the great lake, there was a terrible hunger and many people died. A bear and two little cubs were trying to leave that place and come around the lake where there would be more food.They waited for many days on the beach together. But after a while the two little cubs began to whimper with hunger, and so the bear decided to swim across the rest of the lake.They waded into the water, one cub on each side of the bear, and they swam off into the lake a long way. After a while the cubs began to get very  tired, and so the bear said, 'Try hard, the land is not very far.' And  very soon they did come in sight of the land. But gradually the cubs got weaker, and only ten miles away, one cub sank into the water. Soon after the other also drowned.The bear’s heart was broken, but she could do nothing. She waded ashore and lay down, looking out on the water where her cubs had died. Eventually, both of they came to the surface as two little islands, and so the bear still lies there atop the dunes, looking after her children.”Is there any wildlife at Sleeping Bear Dunes National Seashore?There were lots of birds, and bugs. I saw a black squirrel, but I wasn’t able to get a picture.In the campground, they warn you to use bear precautions with your food, as a precaution to make sure they don’t have bear visitors.Where can you stay in Sleeping Bear Dunes National Seashore?I stayed at Platte River Campground, at the south end of Sleeping Bear Dunes. It was a well-paved, easy to access campground that was about a 20-minute drive to get up to the dunes.The site I chose was in Loop 1, with electricity. Many of the loops do not have electricity, so be sure you know what you’re getting before you press that book now button.There was a dump station and a place to fill your tanks with potable water, if you needed to do so.Book your campsite as far in advance as possible. They allow up to nine months in advance. I had no trouble finding a site four months in advance, but there was no additional availability during my stay, except for non-electric sites.Go torecreation.govto book your reservation.The sites were large and fairly spread out, and I had plenty of room to unhook and store my tow dolly. They have a great camp store where you can get firewood and other camping related items.There is also a more rustic campground available with dirt roads and vault toilets, D.H. Day Campground.Is it worth going to Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore?YES! My only regret is that I didn’t book two nights in the campground, but I am happy with what I was able to do what I did in less than 24 hours.Watch my YouTube video about my experience!If you have any comments, suggestions or questions about Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, or if you would like to know when I publish a new article,you can message me here.Thanks for joining me as I continue Year 2 of this full-time RV life.Subscribe below for updates as we travel and continue to enjoy and learn more about life on the road.Your privacy is important to us, and we do not share your information.

      "Empire Bluff TrailAnother ranger recommendation. I always ask the rangers, either at the campground check in area or at the Visitor's Center, where the best places are to go. Especially if I am limited on time, like on this one-night stop.The trail is about 1.5 miles, and it leads to an overlook where you can admire the entirety of the dunes, and watch an amazing sunset.You can bring your dog, as long as they are on a leash no longer than six feet, but remember it is a three-mile hike total, if you have a short-nose, small dog with less stamina, like Willie.After walking for about 30 minutes, I almost turned around. It was getting dark and I wasn’t sure what I would even find at the end. So I checked my Waze, and saw I was at least on the right trail, and I kept on going. I'm so glad I did.There were benches to sit on, and it seemed to be a very popular place to watch the sunset.",

My site was in Loop 1, the farthest from the lot, but a loop that had electric hookups.So for me, it was about a 3.5 mile hike.The hike was very wooded and flat most of the way. The mosquitoes and biting flies were making me wish I had brought bug spray.The last half mile or so I found myself back in soft, deep, white sand which was more strenuous to walk through.The hike one way took about 45-minutes, and I almost turned back because I had to check out and move on that day. I've had a lot of those situations lately, where I was almost ready to turn back.And again, I would have missed so much.After looking on Waze again to see how much farther away Lake Michigan was, I kept on going, and found myself the only person on the most beautiful beach I have ever been on.The beach was natural and pristine, and the water super clear (and cold for this Florida girl).I sat down at the water’s edge for a while, just to take in the beauty of the location and celebrate sticking my toes in Lake Michigan, my fifth Great Lake, before heading back",

      "Bring the proper gear for your hikeYou don’t need a lot, but I would recommend a few things to make your hikes in Sleeping Bear Dunes more enjoyable.1.  Proper hiking shoes. The trails can be wet and muddy in spots, and sandy. Wearing shoes with non-slip soles helps if your feet get wet, but I did just end up taking my shoes off in the dunes.My favorite hiking shoe is a hiking sandal, that lets my feet breath and expand, as my feet often do as the day goes on.If you would like to know more about my hiking sandals,message me here.2.  Water. It’s always worth having a bottle of water with you, even for a short hike.  You never know.3.  A light snack. I usually carry an Uncrustable frozen peanut butter and jelly sandwich with me. Sometimes you can find a wheat bread version. It gives you an extra jolt of protein to keep going, and it’s easy to carry.4.  Use the bathroom before you start your hike. There are facilities at the beginning of the hikes I talk about today.5.  Bring your cell phone. Even when service was limited or non-existent, like many national parks, I was able to access my route on Waze.6.  Bug spray. The hike from the Platte River Campground to Lake Michigan had so many mosquitoes in the wooded part of the hike. Idid nothave bug spray with me, but I really wish that I did. Now I just keep a bottle in my hiking backpack, just in case.",

      "The Legend of Manitou Islands and the Sleeping Bear“Once, long ago, in the land called Wisconsin across the great lake, there was a terrible hunger and many people died. A bear and two little cubs were trying to leave that place and come around the lake where there would be more food.They waited for many days on the beach together. But after a while the two little cubs began to whimper with hunger, and so the bear decided to swim across the rest of the lake.They waded into the water, one cub on each side of the bear, and they swam off into the lake a long way. After a while the cubs began to get very  tired, and so the bear said, 'Try hard, the land is not very far.' And  very soon they did come in sight of the land. But gradually the cubs got weaker, and only ten miles away, one cub sank into the water. Soon after the other also drowned.The bear’s heart was broken, but she could do nothing. She waded ashore and lay down, looking out on the water where her cubs had died. Eventually, both of they came to the surface as two little islands, and so the bear still lies there atop the dunes, looking after her children.”",

Please see our full disclosurefor more information.Can we make it from Pennsylvania to Florida on a 6-day, 1,100 mile trip while battling a coolant leak and solar power struggles?What else could possibly go wrong?Thanks for joining me on the final leg of my big journey from Florida to Minnesota and back.Day One - Pennsylvania to Delaware.It’s the first time in over three weeks that I have not had people available to me. I mean, I'm staying at a Harvest Host tonight. There's people, but not people I know.I'd been staying at my sister's house, and werea lot of people around, family and friends, for those 3 weeks,which took me a minute to get used to, after being alone on the road for five months. But day one of this trip I was really missing my family.Sunday was a short hour and a half drive. I stayed at a farm in theHarvest Hostnetwork in Newark, Delaware. Most Harvest Hosts do not provide electricity, so I was hoping I have some sunshine on Monday for solar to charge my batteries.By 3:30 I was starting to eat into my battery power. The temperatures got down into the low 40s, so I did need the heat on. I went to bed early to stay warm under layers of quilts, and shut the door from the back of the RV to the front so I was only heating the bedroom area.I’ve also been using thermal curtains between the cab and the living area, as well as putting one up over the door at night to stop any drafts. This has been working so well to help keep the warm in and the cold out.I unplugged as much as possible, including the microwave and the TV, and I ran my refrigerator on propane to help conserve my battery power.The other thing I did was to use myEcoflow portable power bank. I have a power strip that runs everything in the back of the camper that I plugged in to my Ecoflow, instead.The Ecoflow did also get down to about 65% but because of the highway noise, I did let the TV run all night just for ambient background noise. I also charged my phone with it last night.Five days of traveling and the first three were boondocking with no hook ups, in cold weather.Every day before I travel I check my antifreeze (which still has a leak), tighten up the straps on the tow Dolly, and check my tire pressure on the tires that I can reach.Yes, my coolant was still leaking. Even afteran expensive repair in Kentucky.I filled it upeverymorning. It was checked again in Pennsylvania. There's no oil in the coolant, which is a problem with the motor that I have, but that's not thecase. I really think that possibly the coolant reservoir is leaking.I don't know if the mechanic even checked the coolant reservoir in Kentucky, before he fixed the other things he thought it might be. The antifreeze level wasn't going down any more than an inch or two, and there it stays. That is one more thing that will need to be checked out when I get back to Florida.Plan your next road trip! Get RV-friendly GPS, share your trip with friends and family.Day Two - Delaware to VirginiaI stayed at anotherHarvest Hosts, this time at a vineyard outside of Richmond. The weather was beautiful. 71 degrees and 48 at night.I wasn’t happy about traveling with an antifreeze leak, but no one can seem to diagnose the problem, and I wanted to get back to Florida.Everything else went well. No tire or engine trouble. I definitely have some travel PTSD.It was supposed to be a 3 1/2 hour ride, but it was closer to 5 hours. When you're on 95, you know that you're going to have traffic and you're going to have things happen. I did not have any bridges to conquer, but I did have a tunnel in Baltimore.Driving through Baltimore and Washington, DC and I was able to see the Washington Monument.My batteries charged back up to 100% and I was able to recharge myEcoflow.Day 3 - Virginia to North CarolinaI was able to travel on the eastern side of North Carolina and avoid the Asheville area.In June when I came up, before Hurricane Helene, I was in Asheville at the Biltmore Estate.I stayed in Green Mountain, went to Chimney Rock, and went to Grandfather Mountain. All the areas that were hit so hard with the hurricane.Normally I would try to take more back roads, but I've done the back roads from Florida to New Jersey all up and down the coast of North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, but I wanted to get back to Florida and away from the cold weather quickly. I also didn’t want to be driving Thanksgiving week with all the traffic.I tried to stay in Pennsylvania as long as I could without hitting snow or Thanksgiving traffic.I stayed in North Carolina at another Harvest Host. This time it was a brewery. The temperature was in the 70s, and I found my mood improving as I left the colder temperatures behind.It was a fairly uneventful day. About a 4 1/2 trip. I did stop for gas, and that always takes a extra time with a 50-gallon diesel tank. I don't drive as quickly as many of the other people on the road. 55 mph with the tow dolly; however, the traffic was fairly light and it was a nice day for a drive.This place, much to Willie's happiness, had a dog park. I've never been to a Harvest Host with a dog park, so he was just thrilled that he could run around off leash and get some energy out.I also enjoyed an adult beverage and play trivia, and was Taco Tuesday, complete with a delicious food truck.Day three, I would have to say, was a success, except …The strangest thing happened around 8:00. All of a sudden my internet went out, and I quickly realized out thatallmy 120 volt plugs were not working, my inverter was not working, and my heater was not working. So everything just kind of went blank, and I didn't know what to do. I tried to reset a fuse, which I've done before if the 120s stop working, but I've never had the heater or AC stop working. I didn't overload it, as I had very little running.So I reset the whole thing, which was scary because it literally put me in the dark for a minute or two. I reset the battery, and that didn't seem to do anything. I started the truck up and let that run for a little while and slowly everything seemed to come back online again. My internet and the 120-volt outlets started to work and my heater started to work, which was good because it was a little chilly that night at 59 degrees. That was my fun experience of the nightI was just hoping things will just continue to go smoothly. Three more days to get back to Florida.Day 4 - North Carolina to South Carolina, and almost a huge mistake!Wednesday night, day four of six on my travels. I made it into South Carolina. I took the Jeep off the tow dolly and went and looked around the area a little bit. I'd been at this campground before.The last time I was here I tried to see a church that was in the Forrest Gump movie. I did findachurch on the corner, not realizing that you had to turn the corner and drive back another 100 feet to see the Forrest Gump church, so I wanted to do that.It had been driving me a little crazy ever since I realized my faux pas last year. So I went and found the Forrest Gump church. One more thing off my bucket list.Wednesday was an uneventful drive through South Carolina. No offense, but once you get past South of the Border, it isthe most boringdrive. The roads up until that point were very smooth and easy to drive. In South Carolina the roads were very bumpy with a lot of construction.When I first started my day, there was rain and fog, so everyone was driving a little slower. But once the fog lifted, everyone sped up, the roads got very rough, and things in the RV started to shake up and move around. Things that havenevermoved around before.I was still having to put antifreeze in every day. It will be interesting to see what happens when I'm staying in one place for a few days. Will the level continue to go down more every day or will it continue to stop at the two-inches from the top mark?I still think the leak in my coolant reservoir. If I look underneath where the reservoir is, there's a little section that holds liquid and it looks like there's some antifreeze there. Also, I've been wiping the whole Reservoir down on the outside with a paper towel every morning, but I'm seeing residue the next day. I have a feeling that I may have finally found the problem.It is probably not the best idea to continue to drive, but with only six hours of driving to go, no smoke or strange smells coming from the engine, and the coolant temperature staying where it’s supposed to, I pushed on and hoped for the best.Two more driving days. Thursday is about four hours with another two hours or so on Friday.Hopefully Friday will just be as good as the other days have been and we'll be back in Orlando for the winter.Day 5 - South Carolina to Flagler Beach, Florida.Back in Florida and staying at a Thousand Trails campground, which is “free” to me.Today I avoided a terrible disaster.I was in South Carolina getting ready to leave and I needed to get gas.At the gas station, I went to put my card in the gas pump and noticed the pump said “must pay inside”. Such a pain in the neck, but I went inside to pay.I explained to the attendant what pump I was at, and the woman was very clear with me, or tried to be very clear with me (I was a little dense) about the diesel pump being the middle pump. I said “Okay I got it”, but I didn't get it. Until I got outside and looked again.The problem was that the handles at the pump at this gas station had green handles on the gas pumps. Usually green pumps mean diesel. So I camethisclose to putting regular gas in my diesel, which would have been disastrous.I've seen people who've done it before. It can ruin your whole motorhome.It really scared me when I realized how close I had come to putting gas in my diesel tank.Thank God there was a sign that I had to go inside and pay. I think it was the only pump with that message as the other gas pump front of me did not say that.So just by a stroke of luck, I did not have a major disaster.Everything else went well. The engine ran great. It didn't smell like coolant when I was driving. I wiped off the coolant reservoir and again it had a little trace of coolant, so I'm pretty sure that's where the problem is coming from.Thursday the drive was really good, about 4 ½ hours. Driving through Jacksonville is always a nightmare but I made it through.I got to the RV park, pulled in, and the entrance signage was very unclear. It didn't say \"check in this way\" or anything. So I drove up around a building, figuring I could go around the building, only to find out that it dead ended at the pool. So I had to take the Jeep off the tow dolly, back up the tow dolly, and then go in through the other road, the unmarked “entrance”. I should have stopped and looked first.When in doubt stop and look before you continue.I cried when I reached Florida, just like I cried when I got toVoyageurs National Parkin Minnesota. Tears of joy and happiness, or tears of relief that I made it somewhere without dying? Or are they both the same?One more travel day. It seems like I left Pennsylvania just in time, because they had snow over the weekend, which is exactly what I was trying to avoid.Day 6 - Flagler Beach to Orlando Florida.Another gratefully uneventful travel day. I moved from the East Coast of Florida over to Central Florida, so down through Orlando on route 4, which can be a little crazy. The lanes tend to go from 4 to 6 to 5 to three, so you really have to pay attention and pick a lane and stay in it so that you will not have to move back and forth all the time.It was 100 miles and about 2 hours of driving.Overall, the six-day, 1,100 mile trip from Pennsylvania to Florida was a successful and uneventful trip. I really needed a good trip with no “surprises” to help make up for some of the other travel I’ve had this year.And yes, I'm already thinking about where I’ll go next year!There were times this year where I thought about calling it quits, but this full-time RV life is very addicting, and I have more adventures to live and places to see in 2025.Thanks for joining me.

I definitely have some travel PTSD.It was supposed to be a 3 1/2 hour ride, but it was closer to 5 hours. When you're on 95, you know that you're going to have traffic and you're going to have things happen. I did not have any bridges to conquer, but I did have a tunnel in Baltimore.Driving through Baltimore and Washington, DC and I was able to see the Washington Monument.My batteries charged back up to 100% and I was able to recharge myEcoflow.Day 3 - Virginia to North CarolinaI was able to travel on the eastern side of North Carolina and avoid the Asheville area.In June when I came up, before Hurricane Helene, I was in Asheville at the Biltmore Estate.I stayed in Green Mountain, went to Chimney Rock, and went to Grandfather Mountain. All the areas that were hit so hard with the hurricane.Normally I would try to take more back roads, but I've done the back roads from Florida to New Jersey all up and down the coast of North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, but I wanted to get back to Florida and away from the cold weather quickly. I also didn’t want to be driving Thanksgiving week with all the traffic.I tried to stay in Pennsylvania as long as I could without hitting snow or Thanksgiving traffic.I stayed in North Carolina at another Harvest Host. This time it was a brewery. The temperature was in the 70s, and I found my mood improving as I left the colder temperatures behind.It was a fairly uneventful day. About a 4 1/2 trip. I did stop for gas, and that always takes a extra time with a 50-gallon diesel tank. I don't drive as quickly as many of the other people on the road. 55 mph with the tow dolly; however, the traffic was fairly light and it was a nice day for a drive.This place, much to Willie's happiness, had a dog park. I've never been to a Harvest Host with a dog park, so he was just thrilled that he could run around off leash and get some energy out.I also enjoyed an adult beverage and play trivia, and was Taco Tuesday, complete with a delicious food truck.Day three, I would have to say, was a success, except …The strangest thing happened around 8:00. All of a sudden my internet went out, and I quickly realized out thatallmy 120 volt plugs were not working, my inverter was not working, and my heater was not working. So everything just kind of went blank, and I didn't know what to do. I tried to reset a fuse, which I've done before if the 120s stop working, but I've never had the heater or AC stop working. I didn't overload it, as I had very little running.So I reset the whole thing, which was scary because it literally put me in the dark for a minute or two. I reset the battery, and that didn't seem to do anything. I started the truck up and let that run for a little while and slowly everything seemed to come back online again. My internet and the 120-volt outlets started to work and my heater started to work, which was good because it was a little chilly that night at 59 degrees. That was my fun experience of the nightI was just hoping things will just continue to go smoothly. Three more days to get back to Florida.Day 4 - North Carolina to South Carolina, and almost a huge mistake!Wednesday night, day four of six on my travels. I made it into South Carolina. I took the Jeep off the tow dolly and went and looked around the area a little bit. I'd been at this campground before.The last time I was here I tried to see a church that was in the Forrest Gump movie. I did findachurch on the corner, not realizing that you had to turn the corner and drive back another 100 feet to see the Forrest Gump church, so I wanted to do that.It had been driving me a little crazy ever since I realized my faux pas last year. So I went and found the Forrest Gump church. One more thing off my bucket list.Wednesday was an uneventful drive through South Carolina. No offense, but once you get past South of the Border, it isthe most boringdrive. The roads up until that point were very smooth and easy to drive. In South Carolina the roads were very bumpy with a lot of construction.When I first started my day, there was rain and fog, so everyone was driving a little slower. But once the fog lifted, everyone sped up, the roads got very rough, and things in the RV started to shake up and move around. Things that havenevermoved around before.I was still having to put antifreeze in every day. It will be interesting to see what happens when I'm staying in one place for a few days. Will the level continue to go down more every day or will it continue to stop at the two-inches from the top mark?I still think the leak in my coolant reservoir. If I look underneath where the reservoir is, there's a little section that holds liquid and it looks like there's some antifreeze there. Also, I've been wiping the whole Reservoir down on the outside with a paper towel every morning, but I'm seeing residue the next day. I have a feeling that I may have finally found the problem.It is probably not the best idea to continue to drive, but with only six hours of driving to go, no smoke or strange smells coming from the engine, and the coolant temperature staying where it’s supposed to, I pushed on and hoped for the best.Two more driving days. Thursday is about four hours with another two hours or so on Friday.Hopefully Friday will just be as good as the other days have been and we'll be back in Orlando for the winter.Day 5 - South Carolina to Flagler Beach, Florida.Back in Florida and staying at a Thousand Trails campground, which is “free” to me.Today I avoided a terrible disaster.I was in South Carolina getting ready to leave and I needed to get gas.At the gas station, I went to put my card in the gas pump and noticed the pump said “must pay inside”. Such a pain in the neck, but I went inside to pay.I explained to the attendant what pump I was at, and the woman was very clear with me, or tried to be very clear with me (I was a little dense) about the diesel pump being the middle pump. I said “Okay I got it”, but I didn't get it. Until I got outside and looked again.The problem was that the handles at the pump at this gas station had green handles on the gas pumps. Usually green pumps mean diesel. So I camethisclose to putting regular gas in my diesel, which would have been disastrous.I've seen people who've done it before. It can ruin your whole motorhome.It really scared me when I realized how close I had come to putting gas in my diesel tank.Thank God there was a sign that I had to go inside and pay. I think it was the only pump with that message as the other gas pump front of me did not say that.So just by a stroke of luck, I did not have a major disaster.Everything else went well. The engine ran great. It didn't smell like coolant when I was driving. I wiped off the coolant reservoir and again it had a little trace of coolant, so I'm pretty sure that's where the problem is coming from.Thursday the drive was really good, about 4 ½ hours. Driving through Jacksonville is always a nightmare but I made it through.I got to the RV park, pulled in, and the entrance signage was very unclear. It didn't say \"check in this way\" or anything. So I drove up around a building, figuring I could go around the building, only to find out that it dead ended at the pool. So I had to take the Jeep off the tow dolly, back up the tow dolly, and then go in through the other road, the unmarked “entrance”. I should have stopped and looked first.When in doubt stop and look before you continue.I cried when I reached Florida, just like I cried when I got toVoyageurs National Parkin Minnesota. Tears of joy and happiness, or tears of relief that I made it somewhere without dying? Or are they both the same?One more travel day. It seems like I left Pennsylvania just in time, because they had snow over the weekend, which is exactly what I was trying to avoid.Day 6 - Flagler Beach to Orlando Florida.Another gratefully uneventful travel day. I moved from the East Coast of Florida over to Central Florida, so down through Orlando on route 4, which can be a little crazy. The lanes tend to go from 4 to 6 to 5 to three, so you really have to pay attention and pick a lane and stay in it so that you will not have to move back and forth all the time.It was 100 miles and about 2 hours of driving.Overall, the six-day, 1,100 mile trip from Pennsylvania to Florida was a successful and uneventful trip. I really needed a good trip with no “surprises” to help make up for some of the other travel I’ve had this year.And yes, I'm already thinking about where I’ll go next year!There were times this year where I thought about calling it quits, but this full-time RV life is very addicting, and I have more adventures to live and places to see in 2025.Thanks for joining me.

      "Day One - Pennsylvania to Delaware.",
      "It’s the first time in over three weeks that I have not had people available to me. I mean, I'm staying at a Harvest Host tonight. There's people, but not people I know.I'd been staying at my sister's house, and werea lot of people around, family and friends, for those 3 weeks,which took me a minute to get used to, after being alone on the road for five months. But day one of this trip I was really missing my family.Sunday was a short hour and a half drive. I stayed at a farm in theHarvest Hostnetwork in Newark, Delaware. Most Harvest Hosts do not provide electricity, so I was hoping I have some sunshine on Monday for solar to charge my batteries.By 3:30 I was starting to eat into my battery power. The temperatures got down into the low 40s, so I did need the heat on. I went to bed early to stay warm under layers of quilts, and shut the door from the back of the RV to the front so I was only heating the bedroom area.I’ve also been using thermal curtains between the cab and the living area, as well as putting one up over the door at night to stop any drafts. This has been working so well to help keep the warm in and the cold out.I unplugged as much as possible, including the microwave and the TV, and I ran my refrigerator on propane to help conserve my battery power.The other thing I did was to use myEcoflow portable power bank. I have a power strip that runs everything in the back of the camper that I plugged in to my Ecoflow, instead.The Ecoflow did also get down to about 65% but because of the highway noise, I did let the TV run all night just for ambient background noise. I also charged my phone with it last night.Five days of traveling and the first three were boondocking with no hook ups, in cold weather.Every day before I travel I check my antifreeze (which still has a leak), tighten up the straps on the tow Dolly, and check my tire pressure on the tires that I can reach.Yes, my coolant was still leaking. Even afteran expensive repair in Kentucky.I filled it upeverymorning. It was checked again in Pennsylvania. There's no oil in the coolant, which is a problem with the motor that I have, but that's not thecase. I really think that possibly the coolant reservoir is leaking.I don't know if the mechanic even checked the coolant reservoir in Kentucky, before he fixed the other things he thought it might be. The antifreeze level wasn't going down any more than an inch or two, and there it stays. That is one more thing that will need to be checked out when I get back to Florida.",

      "I explained to the attendant what pump I was at, and the woman was very clear with me, or tried to be very clear with me (I was a little dense) about the diesel pump being the middle pump. I said “Okay I got it”, but I didn't get it. Until I got outside and looked again.",
      "The problem was that the handles at the pump at this gas station had green handles on the gas pumps. Usually green pumps mean diesel. So I camethisclose to putting regular gas in my diesel, which would have been disastrous.",
      "I've seen people who've done it before. It can ruin your whole motorhome.It really scared me when I realized how close I had come to putting gas in my diesel tank.",
      "I've seen people who've done it before. It can ruin your whole motorhome.",
      "It really scared me when I realized how close I had come to putting gas in my diesel tank.",
      "Thank God there was a sign that I had to go inside and pay. I think it was the only pump with that message as the other gas pump front of me did not say that.",
      "So just by a stroke of luck, I did not have a major disaster.",
      "Everything else went well. The engine ran great. It didn't smell like coolant when I was driving. I wiped off the coolant reservoir and again it had a little trace of coolant, so I'm pretty sure that's where the problem is coming from.",
      "Thursday the drive was really good, about 4 ½ hours. Driving through Jacksonville is always a nightmare but I made it through.",
      "I got to the RV park, pulled in, and the entrance signage was very unclear. It didn't say \"check in this way\" or anything. So I drove up around a building, figuring I could go around the building, only to find out that it dead ended at the pool. So I had to take the Jeep off the tow dolly, back up the tow dolly, and then go in through the other road, the unmarked “entrance”. I should have stopped and looked first.",
      "When in doubt stop and look before you continue.",
      "I cried when I reached Florida, just like I cried when I got toVoyageurs National Parkin Minnesota. Tears of joy and happiness, or tears of relief that I made it somewhere without dying? Or are they both the same?",
      "One more travel day. It seems like I left Pennsylvania just in time, because they had snow over the weekend, which is exactly what I was trying to avoid.",
      "Day 6 - Flagler Beach to Orlando Florida.",
      "Another gratefully uneventful travel day. I moved from the East Coast of Florida over to Central Florida, so down through Orlando on route 4, which can be a little crazy. The lanes tend to go from 4 to 6 to 5 to three, so you really have to pay attention and pick a lane and stay in it so that you will not have to move back and forth all the time.It was 100 miles and about 2 hours of driving.Overall, the six-day, 1,100 mile trip from Pennsylvania to Florida was a successful and uneventful trip. I really needed a good trip with no “surprises” to help make up for some of the other travel I’ve had this year.And yes, I'm already thinking about where I’ll go next year!There were times this year where I thought about calling it quits, but this full-time RV life is very addicting, and I have more adventures to live and places to see in 2025.Thanks for joining me.

At the same time, the boat tour is not run by the National Parks Service - therefore, you can’t use your national park pass for a discount.Where is Pictured Rocks?It is located between Munising and Grand Marais. When I visited, I stayed at the Munising KOA, about a 30 minute drive to the park and boat tour.What is the best way to see Pictured Rocks?The best way to see 20 miles of the 42-mile shoreline is by boat, and I decided on a 2-hour boat ride. Because this is a larger boat, it is more likely to run even when it’s windy with small craft advisories and other options may be cancelled.The guides will point out many of the different formations and points of interest and talk about the history of the park and the ever changing landscape. I chose the Spray Falls Cruise.Get there about 45 minutes before the boat leaves so you can get a seat on the left-side of the boat for the best views of the shoreline. But you will see everything from the right-hand side of the boat on the way back, without as much narration.I booked my boat tour about a month in advance. There were some people at the campground that were not able to book a cruise during their stay once they arrived at the park, so you may want to consider booking early to guarantee you a spot on the boat.There was plenty of parking close to the dock, and even some areas for small RVs to park.I opted for a seat on the second level, while most people rushed up to the top level.What gives the rocks the red, orange, brown white and even green and blue colors are the different mineral deposits of iron, copper, manganese, and limonite as the water drips between the cracks and crevices in the rocks.Rock arches and sea caves that would be fun to explore by kayak, and the clear, turquoise water color makes you feel like you are in the Caribbean.What do you see on a boat tour of Pictured Rocks?Some of the things that we saw on the boat tour wereMiners Castle, considered to be the most famous of the rock formations in Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore. In 2006 one of the two turrets eroded and fell into the lake, leaving just the one turret you see here.Bridalveil Falls, which was only a trickle when I saw it, but it is much larger in the spring.Sea Caves of All Colors.As the tour went on, the afternoon sun hit the rock formations and created even more beautiful colors.Rainbow Cave,where it always looks like it is raining in the cave. They say if you catch the afternoon light just right, you may see a rainbow here.Indian Headnamed after what some say this massive rock formation resembles.Grand Portal,with its massive 300 foot archway before a partial collapse in the early 1900’s.Battleship Rocksthat resemble 3 battleships headed out to sea.Chapel Covewhere we were able to enter the cove so that you are surrounded on 3 sides with tall colored rock formations, clear, turquoise water below and blue sky aboveChapel Rockwith its single white pine that grows on the rock that is about 250 years old.  If you look closely, you can see that the roots of the tree stretch back to the land.  At one time there was an archway that connected the rock to the mainland, but it collapsed at some point in the 1940s.Spray Falls, best seen from the water with a shipwreck from 1856 at the base of the falls.Lovers Leap- The legend says a Native American woman was heartbroken when her lover did not return from a hunting trip, so she flung herself off the cliff.  The water under the cliff is less than three feet deep.Painted Coveswith its colorful sandstone cliffs that stretch along about 15 miles of coastline.The East Channel Lighthouse located on Grand Island.Hiking Miners Castle TrailMiners Castle formation is the only cliff point accessible by vehicle, where you can drive down a road that will put you within a 10 or 15 minute hike of the Castle and beautiful views of Lake Superior.Along the way you will also find the 50-foot drop of Miners Falls. From here you can continue walking down to the popular Miner’s Beach, where you can swim in the waters of Lake Superior.I was able to stick my toes in the water of the 5th and final great lake on my journey to visit all of the Great Lakes.What else is there to see and do in Pictured Rocks?There are a few other areas and waterfalls you may want to check out, if you have the time, like Munising Falls.Au Sable Point LightHouse, which is open to the public.And Grand Sable Dunes, a file-mile long sand slope as much as 275 feet above Superior Lake on the eastern edge of the park, where they used to send the freshly cut white-pine logs down from the top of the dunes to awaiting freighters below, and another spot, likeSleeping Bear Dunes,where you can run down to the bottom, and then climb the dunes back up to the top.You can also kayak for a closer up view of the rocks or take a glass bottom boat for an up close view of two shipwrecks.There are also over 100 miles of hiking trails with hikes varying from less than 1 mile up to 42 miles on the North Country National Scenic Trail.Is it worth going to Pictured National Lakeshore?YES! I really enjoyed the boat ride. People have asked me if I get lonely doing things by myself, but I have found that on almost every excursion, there is at least one other solo traveler. Somehow, we find each other and enjoy the excursion together.The beauty of the shoreline and the miles of trails that you can explore make this a must see area in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.Just like the best way to experience Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore is by boat, the best way to experience the boat tour is to watch this video below!Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore videoIf you have any comments, suggestions or questions about Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, or if you can subscribe at makingmyownlane.com for my newsletter or notifications about when I publish a new video or blog post.Thanks for joining me as I continue Year 2 of this full-time RV life.Subscribe below for updates as we travel and continue to enjoy and learn more about life on the road.Your privacy is important to us, and we do not share your information.

In 2006 one of the two turrets eroded and fell into the lake, leaving just the one turret you see here.Bridalveil Falls, which was only a trickle when I saw it, but it is much larger in the spring.Sea Caves of All Colors.As the tour went on, the afternoon sun hit the rock formations and created even more beautiful colors.Rainbow Cave,where it always looks like it is raining in the cave. They say if you catch the afternoon light just right, you may see a rainbow here.Indian Headnamed after what some say this massive rock formation resembles.Grand Portal,with its massive 300 foot archway before a partial collapse in the early 1900’s.Battleship Rocksthat resemble 3 battleships headed out to sea.Chapel Covewhere we were able to enter the cove so that you are surrounded on 3 sides with tall colored rock formations, clear, turquoise water below and blue sky aboveChapel Rockwith its single white pine that grows on the rock that is about 250 years old.  If you look closely, you can see that the roots of the tree stretch back to the land.  At one time there was an archway that connected the rock to the mainland, but it collapsed at some point in the 1940s.Spray Falls, best seen from the water with a shipwreck from 1856 at the base of the falls.Lovers Leap- The legend says a Native American woman was heartbroken when her lover did not return from a hunting trip, so she flung herself off the cliff.  The water under the cliff is less than three feet deep.Painted Coveswith its colorful sandstone cliffs that stretch along about 15 miles of coastline.The East Channel Lighthouse located on Grand Island.Hiking Miners Castle TrailMiners Castle formation is the only cliff point accessible by vehicle, where you can drive down a road that will put you within a 10 or 15 minute hike of the Castle and beautiful views of Lake Superior.Along the way you will also find the 50-foot drop of Miners Falls. From here you can continue walking down to the popular Miner’s Beach, where you can swim in the waters of Lake Superior.I was able to stick my toes in the water of the 5th and final great lake on my journey to visit all of the Great Lakes.What else is there to see and do in Pictured Rocks?There are a few other areas and waterfalls you may want to check out, if you have the time, like Munising Falls.Au Sable Point LightHouse, which is open to the public.And Grand Sable Dunes, a file-mile long sand slope as much as 275 feet above Superior Lake on the eastern edge of the park, where they used to send the freshly cut white-pine logs down from the top of the dunes to awaiting freighters below, and another spot, likeSleeping Bear Dunes,where you can run down to the bottom, and then climb the dunes back up to the top.You can also kayak for a closer up view of the rocks or take a glass bottom boat for an up close view of two shipwrecks.There are also over 100 miles of hiking trails with hikes varying from less than 1 mile up to 42 miles on the North Country National Scenic Trail.Is it worth going to Pictured National Lakeshore?YES! I really enjoyed the boat ride. People have asked me if I get lonely doing things by myself, but I have found that on almost every excursion, there is at least one other solo traveler.

The second year wasn't much better because I traveled differently. I added in a Jeep in a tow Dolly and I had some unexpected expenses along the way.Understanding how much full-time RV life can cost and why is key for anyone considering this lifestyle. And your costs will be uniquely yours. And I am finding every year is a little different, depending on how far and fast I travel and how much maintenance/repair work I have that year.I am learning to do more maintenance and repairs on my own. The more experience I gain, the more my confidence level grows in doing these things on my own.To help you with your own estimating and budgeting I've created abudget trackerfor you to download and use for free. But first let me show you my actual expense numbers for 2024 .I didn’t include the initial start up costs on this list. This post is about the monthly/yearly overall cost. But you can check out my post aboutbuying your first RV here, and my post aboutmy initial buy-in on my Thousand Trails membership here.RV Living ExpensesIf  you are looking to start your own RV journey and aren't quite sure where to start, take what you spend on your current monthly expenses, like food, medical care and insurance, and guestimate on the rest. I was fairly accurate in my productions for my first year, so if you are a solo RVer, you can use my estimate as a guestimate.I've divided my expenses into several categories: entertainment, everyday, which is groceries and laundry, health, medical,home, insurance, pets, transportation, utilities. Then broke it down by the month.EntertainmentEntertainment would include my theme park annual passes. If you've been following me at all, you know that I love my theme parks. And so far, I’ve been able to spend my winters in Florida and enjoy the warmer weather.It also includes all of my other outdoor activities such as boat rides, museums, and things that I choose to do during my travels and adventures.My total entertainment came out to $2907 or $286 a month.GroceriesFor groceries, I spent $3,311, about $278 a month.LaundryLast year I spent $150 on laundry, or about $12 a month.  There were a few months I saved money when there was a friend or family member who was kind enough to let me do laundry at their house.HealthHealth, like doctors and dentists appointments came to a total of $360. I’m planning on having a few large medical expenses in 2025, so I've decided to not travel as much this year. I’ll be traveling a little less, and focusing on my health a little more this year.RV Park and Campground ExpensesHome -  the first line item is rent. That is the cost of myThousand Trailsannual membership. That was $1,674 or $140 a month.My other camping fees were for camping for times that I either chose not to camp in a Thousand Trails Park because I had friends who were camping someplace else or I was out of the system because there were not any Thousand Trails Encore parks near where I wanted to stay.There were also times where I stayed on a family member's or friend's property for free!Like the 6 weeks that I was in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, a lot of Wisconsin and Minnesota, as well as on the way back between Pennsylvania and Florida and a little bit of time in Kentucky. It worked out that there was quite a bit of time  that I was out of  and unable to use the Thousand Trails system.There were also times where I stayed on a family member's or friend's property for free!This year the cost for additional camping sites was $2,545 or an average of $212 a month.When you add the Thousand Trails, the yearly cost is $4,219. The monthly cost is $140. Add that to the other camping cost of $212 together, it comes out to $360 a month.Still an amazingly low amount when you consider the cost of a mortgage, rent and utilities each month. Without my Thousand Trails membership, the annual cost of camping would be over $18,000.If you divide that by the 30 days in a month,  it comes out to an average $12 a night in camping costs.Get out and camp! Let me help you get the best deal on a Thousand Trails Camping Pass or Membership.Learn more hereRV InsuranceInsurance - this includes my full-time RV Insurance (which is different and more expensive that part-time RV insurance), health insurance, any supplemental insurance, life insurance, my Jeep insurance and then I put AAA and Good Sam roadside assistance in there, too.  This year, my insurance for everything came to $5081, so my average was $423 a month.PetsPets - $178 a month. That's for food, grooming, and vet visits.RV Gas and Fuel EconomyTransportation - this is a big one. My fuel came to $4,277 total for the year, which was$356 a month. I drove at least 8,000 RV miles this year. Including my fuel for both the RV and the Jeep for a total of $356 a month in fuel.I get about nine gallons a mile on my RV, and I get about 30 gallons a mile on my Jeep.It's nice to have that jeep so that I don't have to have to drive the RV everywhere.The first year I did not have a Jeep. I had to take the RV every place I went.  The grocery store, activities, and parks. I did not have a tow vehicle at all. I was more cautious and careful about the gas usage. I check Google maps when deciding where to go to ensure I would be able to park my rig.I couldn't go everywhere I wanted, because with a 27 foot RV, you have to be careful about where you will fit, and it's kind of a pain to pack up your home every time you go anywhere.RV Repairs and MaintenanceThere is no way to avoid repairs. Just like in a sticks and bricks house, things break. Add to that bumpy roads and additional wear and tear on your RV. It’s not an if you will have repairs, but a when.I really got hit hard on repairs this year.In the beginning of the year I had all the seals on my RV redone. I felt that would be a good thing to do to help avoid leaks and water damage in the future. It was something that was listed to do on my original inspection report before I bought my RV. So I did that this year.Click here to watch a video on RV maintenance.Would I have done the extra maintenance knowing what future repairs Daisy was going to need?  Yes, it had to be done and it was important that it was done to avoid even more expensive repairs in the future.However, when I started to  travel North, within two days I ended up in a diesel shop in Georgia for 4 days while they fixed my high-speed oil pump. Cha-ching.I had another big expense in October. Not quite as big, but still substantial, when I had a coolant leak.My overall repairs and maintenance for 2024 were $6655, or $555 a month. I had budgeted $250 a month, so you can see it's super important to have an emergency fund or an emergency credit card with nothing on it so that when when you run into unexpected situations (and you will), you have a way to pay for them.I prefer using an emergency credit card, and just pay it back at the end of the month so Idon't have to worry about having cash with me or having money in a certain account. It’s important to have access to an emergency fund. Not to discourage you, I would recommend at least $10,000.Whether it's for repairs, hotel rooms, or Air BNBs, $10,000 is a good starting point for an emergency fund. To leave the house and go full-time in an RV without any emergency fund would be frightening, because you just never know what's going to happen.Knowing that you have the money to cover these emergencies provides a peace of mind for not having to go into debt to pay these unavoidable costs.RV UtilitiesLastly, utilities - my phone, my internet,electricity cost  (which was 0 this year), propane,  and water. My total utilities for the year came to $2902 or $240 a month.The total for the year came to $34,844 a month. That includes the $6,000 in repairs. I can't uninclude it, because I paid for it.But,if I take that out, it puts my actual living expenses at about $28,000 a year.How does this compare to your yearly expenses?Your expenses will vary based on where you decide to stay, how far and fast you plan on traveling, the activities you choose to do, and the type of RV you decide to live in.Get your free RV Budget Planner hereFinal Thoughts on the Cost of Full-Time RV LivingI own an older RV. I don't have any payments on it.When you own an older RV, and even newer RVs, you know that there's going to be things that you have to fix. For me,  I would rather have a paid off vehicle with no payments and possibly have to put a little bit more into the repairs than to have to make payments on an RV.My goal was to keep this lifestyle debt-free. There are always tradeoffs. I live in an older, smaller RV, which is actually perfect for traveling. I can fit into many sites that larger RVs cannot fit.I’ve downsized what I own to all fit in a 200 square foot area, including my newly acquired storage unit, so I can travel lighter.I can choose city living or remote living. Take-out food or cooking over a campfire. Spending lots of time with friends and family, or moving around to remote locations and spending time alone.The choice is mine, and my question is, “Why can’t I have it all?” The beauty of this RV life is that I have the choice to choose what I want my life to look like at any given time.I hope you found this post helpful to learn how to keep track of your own expenses and guestimate how much money you would need to start your own RV life.Thanks for reading, and pleaselet me know what you found to be the most surprising expense cost.You can unsubscribe anytime.

      "Transportation - this is a big one. My fuel came to $4,277 total for the year, which was$356 a month. I drove at least 8,000 RV miles this year. Including my fuel for both the RV and the Jeep for a total of $356 a month in fuel.I get about nine gallons a mile on my RV, and I get about 30 gallons a mile on my Jeep.It's nice to have that jeep so that I don't have to have to drive the RV everywhere.The first year I did not have a Jeep. I had to take the RV every place I went.  The grocery store, activities, and parks. I did not have a tow vehicle at all. I was more cautious and careful about the gas usage. I check Google maps when deciding where to go to ensure I would be able to park my rig.I couldn't go everywhere I wanted, because with a 27 foot RV, you have to be careful about where you will fit, and it's kind of a pain to pack up your home every time you go anywhere.",

      "There is no way to avoid repairs. Just like in a sticks and bricks house, things break. Add to that bumpy roads and additional wear and tear on your RV. It’s not an if you will have repairs, but a when.I really got hit hard on repairs this year.In the beginning of the year I had all the seals on my RV redone. I felt that would be a good thing to do to help avoid leaks and water damage in the future. It was something that was listed to do on my original inspection report before I bought my RV. So I did that this year.Click here to watch a video on RV maintenance.Would I have done the extra maintenance knowing what future repairs Daisy was going to need?  Yes, it had to be done and it was important that it was done to avoid even more expensive repairs in the future.However, when I started to  travel North, within two days I ended up in a diesel shop in Georgia for 4 days while they fixed my high-speed oil pump. Cha-ching.I had another big expense in October. Not quite as big, but still substantial, when I had a coolant leak.My overall repairs and maintenance for 2024 were $6655, or $555 a month. I had budgeted $250 a month, so you can see it's super important to have an emergency fund or an emergency credit card with nothing on it so that when when you run into unexpected situations (and you will), you have a way to pay for them.I prefer using an emergency credit card, and just pay it back at the end of the month so Idon't have to worry about having cash with me or having money in a certain account. It’s important to have access to an emergency fund. Not to discourage you, I would recommend at least $10,000.Whether it's for repairs, hotel rooms, or Air BNBs, $10,000 is a good starting point for an emergency fund. To leave the house and go full-time in an RV without any emergency fund would be frightening, because you just never know what's going to happen.Knowing that you have the money to cover these emergencies provides a peace of mind for not having to go into debt to pay these unavoidable costs.",

      "I own an older RV. I don't have any payments on it.When you own an older RV, and even newer RVs, you know that there's going to be things that you have to fix. For me,  I would rather have a paid off vehicle with no payments and possibly have to put a little bit more into the repairs than to have to make payments on an RV.My goal was to keep this lifestyle debt-free. There are always tradeoffs. I live in an older, smaller RV, which is actually perfect for traveling. I can fit into many sites that larger RVs cannot fit.I’ve downsized what I own to all fit in a 200 square foot area, including my newly acquired storage unit, so I can travel lighter.I can choose city living or remote living. Take-out food or cooking over a campfire. Spending lots of time with friends and family, or moving around to remote locations and spending time alone.The choice is mine, and my question is, “Why can’t I have it all?” The beauty of this RV life is that I have the choice to choose what I want my life to look like at any given time.I hope you found this post helpful to learn how to keep track of your own expenses and guestimate how much money you would need to start your own RV life.Thanks for reading, and pleaselet me know what you found to be the most surprising expense cost.",

      "Skip to contentMaking My Own LaneHomeYou TubeRV Budget WorksheetThousand TrailsGift IdeasRV Living ResourcesBlogWork With MeContact meContact meNiagara Falls - The American Side - Waterfall and Camping GuideWritten by Nancy Carter of Making My Own LaneNiagara Falls - The American Side - Waterfall and Camping GuideNiagara Falls is the oldest State Park in the country, being established in 1885. LikeWatkins Glen, I could have stayed all day at the falls just taking in the beauty and the majesty of the water and the rock formations.Niagara Falls State Park was designed by Frederick Law Olmstead, the father of landscape architecture, who also designed the Biltmore Estate Gardens in Asheville, NC, and Central Park, NY.This park is about 400 acres of rapids, waterfalls, islands, 15 miles of hiking trails, and the Niagara Gorge. About 140 of the 400 acres is under water.How long does it take to walk through Niagara Falls State Park?I got there early on a Sunday morning, and there were rainbows everywhere, and the crowds were already starting to form.I spent about three hours walking the falls and through the park.It is a lot of walking, so be sure to wear comfortable, non-slips shoes. There are many areas where the ground is wet from the waterfall spray and mist.I did not see a place to stop and get a map, nor was I offered one at the ranger station/parking area.However, there were large signs with maps, and I took a picture on my phone so I knew where I was and where I wanted to go.A couple of times I did get a little lost. The first time I found myself exactly where I was looking to go, even though I thought I had to walk further.The second time I got lost was on my way back to my car, and I had to walk a little farther than I originally had thought.Luckily, I had a bottle of water, and an Uncrustables, my go-to hiking snack, with me to save me.Are pets allowed on the trails?Pets are allowed on the greenspace and footpaths, but they need to be kept on a leash no longer than six feet long.I did not bring my dogs on the trails, as it was a little hot out and I didn’t know how much walking I would be doing, or if dogs were even allowed.As with the other New York State Parks I’ve been to this year, if you do decide to bring your dog, or cat, be sure to bring copies of their recent rabies certificates, with the expiration date (not the metal tags)Is there an entrance fee for Niagara Falls State Park?There is a parking fee of $10 per vehicle ($20 for RVs and on the weekend) between May 24th and September 3rd, unless you are camping at a New York State Park. Then your camping pass also serves as your parking pass.I parked at Parking Lot 3 at Goat Island, used my pass from 4 Mile Creek Campground and saved $20 to park my Jeep.The parking is RV-friendly, with separate parking for cars and RV’s/buses.The parking fees are the same for cars and RVs.Where should I begin my hike?My first stop was Horseshoe Falls at Terrapin Point. Almost 682,000 gallons of water rush over Horseshoe Falls every second.Next I walked over to Cave of the Winds, but I didn’t go in. You can learn more about Cave of the Winds in the next section.From there I crossed over to Luna Island for some amazing views of Bridal Veil Falls and American Falls, which have approximately another 76,000 gallons of water per second between the two falls.Bridal Veil FallsAmerican FallsI followed that water down to the American Falls pedestrian bridge that crossed over Green Island, and walked up to Prospect Point near American Falls.I kept walking and followed the signs to Maid of the Mist, where I walked out onto the observation deck for more beautiful views of all the falls.After the observation deck, I backtracked over the bridge at Green Island, and made my way to the Three Sisters Islands.What else can I do on the American side of Niagara Falls?Some of the popular things to do at Niagara Falls State Park are:Maid of the Mist- Put on your (provided) blue rain poncho and head directly to the falls! By the time I got there, around 10 am on a Sunday morning, the line was already stretching out onto the walkway. It looked like it was at least an hour wait, so I decided not to do this. The boat ride is open from 9 am to 6 pm seven days a week.Observation Tower- Instead, I paid the $1.65 entrance fee to the maid of the mist observation walkway, where you can walk out over the river for some great views of the falls. If you do the Maid of the Mist boat tour, the price of the observation deck is included with your admission.Cave of the Winds- You will take a ride in an elevator 175 feet down, be given a yellow poncho to wear, and walk a series of wooden boardwalks to the Hurricane Deck to get an up close experience with Bridal Veil Falls. The cave is open from 9 am to 8 pm, but these hours may be different in the winter.Three Sisters Islands- Three small islands connected by footbridges to Goat Island, where you will see the most beautiful views and really experience the power and force of the water of the Niagara River.Rainbow Bridge- you can walk or drive over the Rainbow Bridge from the United States to Canada. You will need a passport for everyone in your vehicle. I did think about doing this; however, the Canadian side looked very commercial, so I stayed on the less commercial US side and enjoyed the many walking trails and American-side views.Niagara Scenic Trolley- Take a 3-mile, guided tour ride where you can hop on and hop at some of Niagara Falls state park attractions. The price of the ticket is $3. I did see the trolley, but I decided to walk on my own instead of riding the trolley.Niagara Helicopters and Rainbow Air- Helicopter rides near the falls.Falls Illumination- see the lights shine from three different locations along the falls every night of the year.Fireworks nightly displayat 10 pm from May 17th to October 14th.Is there any wildlife on the Niagara Gorge Trail?I saw a black squirrel, but they say you may also see Peregrine Falcon and American Bald Eagle.Where did I stay in Niagara Falls?I stayed at 4 Mile Creek State Park, about 30 minutes northwest of Niagara Falls, right on Lake Ontario, the first the five Great Lakes on my RV Road Trip.The site I chose had an amazing water view of Lake Erie from my front window, which I parked to face the lake.

      "Niagara Falls - The American Side - Waterfall and Camping GuideWritten by Nancy Carter of Making My Own LaneNiagara Falls - The American Side - Waterfall and Camping GuideNiagara Falls is the oldest State Park in the country, being established in 1885. LikeWatkins Glen, I could have stayed all day at the falls just taking in the beauty and the majesty of the water and the rock formations.Niagara Falls State Park was designed by Frederick Law Olmstead, the father of landscape architecture, who also designed the Biltmore Estate Gardens in Asheville, NC, and Central Park, NY.This park is about 400 acres of rapids, waterfalls, islands, 15 miles of hiking trails, and the Niagara Gorge. About 140 of the 400 acres is under water.How long does it take to walk through Niagara Falls State Park?I got there early on a Sunday morning, and there were rainbows everywhere, and the crowds were already starting to form.I spent about three hours walking the falls and through the park.It is a lot of walking, so be sure to wear comfortable, non-slips shoes. There are many areas where the ground is wet from the waterfall spray and mist.I did not see a place to stop and get a map, nor was I offered one at the ranger station/parking area.However, there were large signs with maps, and I took a picture on my phone so I knew where I was and where I wanted to go.A couple of times I did get a little lost. The first time I found myself exactly where I was looking to go, even though I thought I had to walk further.The second time I got lost was on my way back to my car, and I had to walk a little farther than I originally had thought.Luckily, I had a bottle of water, and an Uncrustables, my go-to hiking snack, with me to save me.Are pets allowed on the trails?Pets are allowed on the greenspace and footpaths, but they need to be kept on a leash no longer than six feet long.I did not bring my dogs on the trails, as it was a little hot out and I didn’t know how much walking I would be doing, or if dogs were even allowed.As with the other New York State Parks I’ve been to this year, if you do decide to bring your dog, or cat, be sure to bring copies of their recent rabies certificates, with the expiration date (not the metal tags)Is there an entrance fee for Niagara Falls State Park?There is a parking fee of $10 per vehicle ($20 for RVs and on the weekend) between May 24th and September 3rd, unless you are camping at a New York State Park. Then your camping pass also serves as your parking pass.I parked at Parking Lot 3 at Goat Island, used my pass from 4 Mile Creek Campground and saved $20 to park my Jeep.The parking is RV-friendly, with separate parking for cars and RV’s/buses.The parking fees are the same for cars and RVs.Where should I begin my hike?My first stop was Horseshoe Falls at Terrapin Point. Almost 682,000 gallons of water rush over Horseshoe Falls every second.Next I walked over to Cave of the Winds, but I didn’t go in. You can learn more about Cave of the Winds in the next section.From there I crossed over to Luna Island for some amazing views of Bridal Veil Falls and American Falls, which have approximately another 76,000 gallons of water per second between the two falls.Bridal Veil FallsAmerican FallsI followed that water down to the American Falls pedestrian bridge that crossed over Green Island, and walked up to Prospect Point near American Falls.I kept walking and followed the signs to Maid of the Mist, where I walked out onto the observation deck for more beautiful views of all the falls.After the observation deck, I backtracked over the bridge at Green Island, and made my way to the Three Sisters Islands.What else can I do on the American side of Niagara Falls?Some of the popular things to do at Niagara Falls State Park are:Maid of the Mist- Put on your (provided) blue rain poncho and head directly to the falls! By the time I got there, around 10 am on a Sunday morning, the line was already stretching out onto the walkway. It looked like it was at least an hour wait, so I decided not to do this. The boat ride is open from 9 am to 6 pm seven days a week.Observation Tower- Instead, I paid the $1.65 entrance fee to the maid of the mist observation walkway, where you can walk out over the river for some great views of the falls. If you do the Maid of the Mist boat tour, the price of the observation deck is included with your admission.Cave of the Winds- You will take a ride in an elevator 175 feet down, be given a yellow poncho to wear, and walk a series of wooden boardwalks to the Hurricane Deck to get an up close experience with Bridal Veil Falls. The cave is open from 9 am to 8 pm, but these hours may be different in the winter.Three Sisters Islands- Three small islands connected by footbridges to Goat Island, where you will see the most beautiful views and really experience the power and force of the water of the Niagara River.Rainbow Bridge- you can walk or drive over the Rainbow Bridge from the United States to Canada. You will need a passport for everyone in your vehicle. I did think about doing this; however, the Canadian side looked very commercial, so I stayed on the less commercial US side and enjoyed the many walking trails and American-side views.Niagara Scenic Trolley- Take a 3-mile, guided tour ride where you can hop on and hop at some of Niagara Falls state park attractions. The price of the ticket is $3. I did see the trolley, but I decided to walk on my own instead of riding the trolley.Niagara Helicopters and Rainbow Air- Helicopter rides near the falls.Falls Illumination- see the lights shine from three different locations along the falls every night of the year.Fireworks nightly displayat 10 pm from May 17th to October 14th.Is there any wildlife on the Niagara Gorge Trail?I saw a black squirrel, but they say you may also see Peregrine Falcon and American Bald Eagle.Where did I stay in Niagara Falls?I stayed at 4 Mile Creek State Park, about 30 minutes northwest of Niagara Falls, right on Lake Ontario, the first the five Great Lakes on my RV Road Trip.The site I chose had an amazing water view of Lake Erie from my front window, which I parked to face the lake. I didn’t have any electric, water or sewer hookups, but I did have one of the best views in the park, and lots of sunshine to fill my batteries back up during the day.There was a dump station and a place to fill your tanks with potable water, if you needed to do so.Book your campsite as far in advance as possible.

It's the perfect opportunity to re-evaluate your priorities and focus on what truly adds value. But what if you live in a larger space? Can you still learn to live with less? It starts with a ruthless decluttering process. Everything that doesn't serve a purpose or bring joy has to go. It's not about depriving yourself of things you love, but about creating an environment that sparks joy and simplicity.But, it’s a daily struggle. Being emotionally attached to things, dealing with people who want to give you their stuff, and the constant pressure to buy more stuff. Consumerism that is handed to us every day in the form of commercials on our computers, our phones, and our TVs that give you that FOMO, or fear of missing out, feeling - missing out on what others have that you don’t.I chose not to buy a lot of things, not because I can’t afford them, but because I want to live a more simple life, where I am not controlled by having so much stuff to take care of.  The more you have, the more you have to maintain and keep up. I can afford more, I choose not to spend more.This blog post is not designed to offend anyone, or anyone’s current lifestyle or the decision to live a certain lifestyle.  Everyone is different, so a one-size fits all lifestyle isn’t what I’m about here.I’m just sharing the way I have chosen to live for the past year and a half. This is the phase of life that I am in. A phase of freedom, personal growth, and peace, and I can’t imagine going back to the lifestyle of consumerism that I once lived.Now I consume only what I need, but not excessively. I consume only what I need and what I will use, and I have become much more intentional in my spending.Almost everything I own serves multiple purposes. For example, I have a rolling storage box that acts as a liquor cabinet and can also serve as a seat if I have company, my microwave doubles as storage for snacks and crackers. It helps keep things fresh. My shower is the perfect place to keep the kitty litter box.   and everything gets used on a regular basis. Anything I own has earned its spot in my tiny home.I don’t claim to be a minimalist, but I do live a minimalistic type of simpler life, where I value experiences over things.How do I decide what to buy?When I am making a decision to buy something new, the first question I ask myself is, where will I put it?  Living in a smaller space has helped me to really think about what I buy before I buy it.The next question is, what joy will this item bring to my life and for how long?And the third question I ask myself is, will it make me more comfortable? For example, will it keep me warm on a cold day or give me more time to do the things I really want to do?Recent purchase -inflatable paddleboard. It took me 3 months to make the purchase. I chose one that has the \"double-paddle\" and is easier to paddle when you're sitting.Let’s put it to the test.Yes, it does take up space in my home, but it’s smaller than a non-inflatable paddle-board or kayak.While I don’t use it every day, being able to get out on the water on a beautiful lake has given me a lot of enjoyment and peace.  There’s nothing like floating around and exploring a lake on a warm summer day, and I will be able to use it for years to come as I continue to explore the US and find new lakes, streams, and springs.Check out my Amazon Shopfor more items that make my RV life even more enjoyable!6 benefits of living with less1.Mental minimalism- Having less gives me more peace, more time for new experiences and personal growth, and more contentment. More time to focus on the people and things that are important to me, instead of the burden of having to take care of so much stuff, and live a fuller, more intentional life. I felt that when I owned a houseful of things, those things owned me. My time, my energy, and the money it took to maintain all those things. I found that I was exhausted trying to keep up with my old life of maintaining everything I owned.Obviously I still have things to maintain, but I maintain only what I need to live a life of travel.2.Emotional minimalism- not having as many emotional attachments to what I own. Everything serves a purpose.3.Less clutter… so there is still clutter, even with living with less. And yes, I still “lose” things in my home, but I find that I find them much faster. Everything has a place, and I don’t have many places to put things. As long as I put things back in their assigned place, I don’t lose things. I’m still working on getting better at that.4.  Another benefit I have found is that I have moreflexibility and freedomto be more generous in my time with helping others. I am able to take more time to nurture and enjoy relationships in my life.5.Less debt/less stress. I bought a used RV in good condition that I could afford, not a new one that I would have had to make payments on. I researched and made a list of what I thought I needed, andI found that RV.Exactly. It’s small, but it has everything I need to live comfortably and travel easily.And yes, I had to sell my house to live a life I love. Debt-free and on my own terms.6.  I am able torealign my life with my greatest passions. Living a “smaller” life has allowed me to live larger and spend more time with the people I love, in different parts of the country, and do the things that I really enjoy while I am able to do them.Do you want to be remembered for your net worth and the cool stuff you own or for the positive way you made people feel and the difference you made in someone else’s life?How I downsized my belongingsI started by not replacing things just because society said it was time. I kept my older car with plenty of life left in it, and no car payment, even though I could have bought a new car, I chose to use what I had.Wearing clothes that I have instead of buying something new.Basically, enjoying and being thankful for what I have instead of always wanting more so I could be the same as everyone else and have the same things that everyone else had.When I moved into my tiny home on wheels, I made a list of things I already had that I wanted to bring with me. Actually, it was pretty easy. I listed those items in the order of how important they were to me and my daily living expectations, and when I ran out of room, I was done! Everything else had to go.I decorated with things I already had that reminded me of my family and friends, or things that I had experienced.  My art was created by my daughter back when she was in high school, and it makes me happy to look at it every day.My knick-knacks are gifts from people I love that have been given to me over the years. When I look at them I am reminded of that person.My quilts were made for me. One by my daughter, and one by my mother and completed by my sister. Not only are they beautiful, they help keep me warm on cold nights.Simply put, I decorate with memories.I still have a lot of things that are very sentimental to me, just noteveryletter, card, picture, or piece of artwork from the times my daughters were 3. I gave those things to my daughters to enjoy.I divided up our scrapbooks. A few for me, and few for them. And our home videos, many of which sadly, didn’t hold up to time. But my daughters can decide if they someday want to get them restored. They are their memories too.  I boxed their things up and dropped them off at their homes, and they can decide what to keep and what not to keep.I let my daughters pick their favorite things in my house, from furniture and antiques to dishware, holiday decorations and books. I did not judge what they chose and what they did not choose to take. The only thing I asked was that they use it and enjoy it, not just stick it away in their attic.I gave my friends things that they wanted, and I gave my favorite dog groomer all of my depression glass because she collected it and it gave her joy.Everything else I sold or donated -in 27 days. Probably for the best because I didn’t have the time or energy to worry about what I was doing.And one and a half years later, I can’t think of a thing I miss.I enjoy going to my family and friends' homes and seeing them enjoy what I gave them. It’s not my stuff anymore.Maintaining a minimalist mindset is just as important as implementing practical hacks. It's essential to regularly assess your belongings and habits to ensure they still align with your values and priorities. This mindfulness practice helps me stay focused on what's truly important and avoid falling into old patterns.After living in my RV for a year, I let go of even more things. Things that I was tired of moving around or stepping over. Things that I wasn’t using that were taking up much-needed space. I happily rehomed them and gave myself more living space.I also made some internal design changes to give me more room and space to walk around.I had a friend that was redoing her RV, and she gave me her old set up, which works perfectly for me, and it was free! The total amount I spent reconfiguring my RV was $75. $50 for an oversized chair that I could sit in with one of my dogs, and a new, washable rug to make it feel more like a home and less like an RV.Less stuff, better organized, and a lot less stress.This simple life concept is something that has been reinforced in my travels this year to some very remote places. Learning how some people lived  a very minimalistic, functionality-based based lifestyle that allowed them to live their dreams, appreciate their surroundings, and find peace and personal satisfaction living a simpler lifestyle.If you found this helpful, you may want to check out some of my otherRV product reviewsorhelpful resourcesto help make you RV adventures even more memorable and enjoyable.You canwatch my YouTube video review here!Subscribe below for more updates as we travel.Your privacy is important to us, and we do not share your information.

I kept my older car with plenty of life left in it, and no car payment, even though I could have bought a new car, I chose to use what I had.Wearing clothes that I have instead of buying something new.Basically, enjoying and being thankful for what I have instead of always wanting more so I could be the same as everyone else and have the same things that everyone else had.When I moved into my tiny home on wheels, I made a list of things I already had that I wanted to bring with me. Actually, it was pretty easy. I listed those items in the order of how important they were to me and my daily living expectations, and when I ran out of room, I was done! Everything else had to go.I decorated with things I already had that reminded me of my family and friends, or things that I had experienced.  My art was created by my daughter back when she was in high school, and it makes me happy to look at it every day.My knick-knacks are gifts from people I love that have been given to me over the years. When I look at them I am reminded of that person.My quilts were made for me. One by my daughter, and one by my mother and completed by my sister. Not only are they beautiful, they help keep me warm on cold nights.Simply put, I decorate with memories.I still have a lot of things that are very sentimental to me, just noteveryletter, card, picture, or piece of artwork from the times my daughters were 3. I gave those things to my daughters to enjoy.I divided up our scrapbooks. A few for me, and few for them. And our home videos, many of which sadly, didn’t hold up to time. But my daughters can decide if they someday want to get them restored. They are their memories too.  I boxed their things up and dropped them off at their homes, and they can decide what to keep and what not to keep.I let my daughters pick their favorite things in my house, from furniture and antiques to dishware, holiday decorations and books. I did not judge what they chose and what they did not choose to take. The only thing I asked was that they use it and enjoy it, not just stick it away in their attic.I gave my friends things that they wanted, and I gave my favorite dog groomer all of my depression glass because she collected it and it gave her joy.Everything else I sold or donated -in 27 days. Probably for the best because I didn’t have the time or energy to worry about what I was doing.And one and a half years later, I can’t think of a thing I miss.I enjoy going to my family and friends' homes and seeing them enjoy what I gave them. It’s not my stuff anymore.Maintaining a minimalist mindset is just as important as implementing practical hacks. It's essential to regularly assess your belongings and habits to ensure they still align with your values and priorities. This mindfulness practice helps me stay focused on what's truly important and avoid falling into old patterns.After living in my RV for a year, I let go of even more things. Things that I was tired of moving around or stepping over. Things that I wasn’t using that were taking up much-needed space. I happily rehomed them and gave myself more living space.I also made some internal design changes to give me more room and space to walk around.I had a friend that was redoing her RV, and she gave me her old set up, which works perfectly for me, and it was free! The total amount I spent reconfiguring my RV was $75. $50 for an oversized chair that I could sit in with one of my dogs, and a new, washable rug to make it feel more like a home and less like an RV.Less stuff, better organized, and a lot less stress.This simple life concept is something that has been reinforced in my travels this year to some very remote places. Learning how some people lived  a very minimalistic, functionality-based based lifestyle that allowed them to live their dreams, appreciate their surroundings, and find peace and personal satisfaction living a simpler lifestyle.If you found this helpful, you may want to check out some of my otherRV product reviewsorhelpful resourcesto help make you RV adventures even more memorable and enjoyable.You canwatch my YouTube video review here!Subscribe below for more updates as we travel.Your privacy is important to us, and we do not share your information.

      "You really don’t need a lot to be happy.Just for fun, if you could only have 3 things in your house to make you  happy, what would you choose?For me it’s a cozy bed, a 42” TV, and my Keurig coffee pot.Living in a small space helps to force you to be intentional about what you bring into your life. It's the perfect opportunity to re-evaluate your priorities and focus on what truly adds value. But what if you live in a larger space? Can you still learn to live with less? It starts with a ruthless decluttering process. Everything that doesn't serve a purpose or bring joy has to go. It's not about depriving yourself of things you love, but about creating an environment that sparks joy and simplicity.But, it’s a daily struggle. Being emotionally attached to things, dealing with people who want to give you their stuff, and the constant pressure to buy more stuff. Consumerism that is handed to us every day in the form of commercials on our computers, our phones, and our TVs that give you that FOMO, or fear of missing out, feeling - missing out on what others have that you don’t.I chose not to buy a lot of things, not because I can’t afford them, but because I want to live a more simple life, where I am not controlled by having so much stuff to take care of.  The more you have, the more you have to maintain and keep up. I can afford more, I choose not to spend more.This blog post is not designed to offend anyone, or anyone’s current lifestyle or the decision to live a certain lifestyle.  Everyone is different, so a one-size fits all lifestyle isn’t what I’m about here.I’m just sharing the way I have chosen to live for the past year and a half. This is the phase of life that I am in. A phase of freedom, personal growth, and peace, and I can’t imagine going back to the lifestyle of consumerism that I once lived.Now I consume only what I need, but not excessively. I consume only what I need and what I will use, and I have become much more intentional in my spending.Almost everything I own serves multiple purposes. For example, I have a rolling storage box that acts as a liquor cabinet and can also serve as a seat if I have company, my microwave doubles as storage for snacks and crackers. It helps keep things fresh. My shower is the perfect place to keep the kitty litter box.   and everything gets used on a regular basis. Anything I own has earned its spot in my tiny home.I don’t claim to be a minimalist, but I do live a minimalistic type of simpler life, where I value experiences over things.",

      "When I am making a decision to buy something new, the first question I ask myself is, where will I put it?  Living in a smaller space has helped me to really think about what I buy before I buy it.The next question is, what joy will this item bring to my life and for how long?And the third question I ask myself is, will it make me more comfortable? For example, will it keep me warm on a cold day or give me more time to do the things I really want to do?Recent purchase -inflatable paddleboard. It took me 3 months to make the purchase. I chose one that has the \"double-paddle\" and is easier to paddle when you're sitting.Let’s put it to the test.Yes, it does take up space in my home, but it’s smaller than a non-inflatable paddle-board or kayak.While I don’t use it every day, being able to get out on the water on a beautiful lake has given me a lot of enjoyment and peace.  There’s nothing like floating around and exploring a lake on a warm summer day, and I will be able to use it for years to come as I continue to explore the US and find new lakes, streams, and springs.",

      "1.Mental minimalism- Having less gives me more peace, more time for new experiences and personal growth, and more contentment. More time to focus on the people and things that are important to me, instead of the burden of having to take care of so much stuff, and live a fuller, more intentional life. I felt that when I owned a houseful of things, those things owned me. My time, my energy, and the money it took to maintain all those things. I found that I was exhausted trying to keep up with my old life of maintaining everything I owned.Obviously I still have things to maintain, but I maintain only what I need to live a life of travel.2.Emotional minimalism- not having as many emotional attachments to what I own. Everything serves a purpose.3.Less clutter… so there is still clutter, even with living with less. And yes, I still “lose” things in my home, but I find that I find them much faster. Everything has a place, and I don’t have many places to put things. As long as I put things back in their assigned place, I don’t lose things. I’m still working on getting better at that.4.  Another benefit I have found is that I have moreflexibility and freedomto be more generous in my time with helping others. I am able to take more time to nurture and enjoy relationships in my life.5.Less debt/less stress. I bought a used RV in good condition that I could afford, not a new one that I would have had to make payments on. I researched and made a list of what I thought I needed, andI found that RV.Exactly. It’s small, but it has everything I need to live comfortably and travel easily.And yes, I had to sell my house to live a life I love. Debt-free and on my own terms.6.  I am able torealign my life with my greatest passions. Living a “smaller” life has allowed me to live larger and spend more time with the people I love, in different parts of the country, and do the things that I really enjoy while I am able to do them.Do you want to be remembered for your net worth and the cool stuff you own or for the positive way you made people feel and the difference you made in someone else’s life?",

The closest US Interstate Highway is about 5 hours away. There are less than 100 year-round residents.There are only two roads into and out of Copper Harbor.US Highway 41 - an eleven-mile two-lane roadway winding through a tunnel of trees. Highway 41 stretches from Copper Harbor all the way to Florida.   Video This is the road that I decided to take because it was what my RV-friendly GPS recommended both ways.Highway M-26 - or Lakeshore Drive, which primarily follows Lake Superior.At about the 5.5 miles mark on US Highway 41, you will find the world’s largest snow thermometer. The snowfall average is 270 inches.The Astor Shipwreck of 1844I was drawn to a beautiful area along Lake Superior, about a 5-minute drive from the campground. As you look into the distance, you can see a lighthouse, the Copper Harbor Lighthouse.The only way to visit this lighthouse is by a guided boat tour.If you read the signage at the lakefront, you realize that you are looking at the exact site of the wreck of the schooner-style ship, the John Jacob Astor in 1844.No lives were lost, but the schooner was left in the small harbor until it just broke apart with the wreckage scattered between the Fort Wilkins dock and the Copper Harbor lighthouse.How many days do you need in Copper Harbor?I was there for two nights. You can also book a boat to Isle Royale National Park and leave your car or RV in Copper Harbor across from the dock.I was there in late August, and the boat tours were already running less frequently.Hint: book your boat tours well in advance to make sure you can get one, and check directly with the boat tour company when you get to Copper Harbor for any scheduling changes or cancellations.The town itself is less than 10-blocks long, so the best way to experience it is to park your vehicle and start walking.Where is there to do in Copper Harbor?There were a few restaurants in town, the town’s one room schoolhouse, the post office/Copper Harbor Museum, a couple of coffee shops, with the best one being near the boat tours, in my opinion.You will also find some small motel-type places to stay, and some eclectic and interesting shops, including the Copper Harbor Trading Post, which also has basic grocery items in case you forgot something.If you’re still craving the excitement of remote exploration, there are other historical sites to see, like the Estivant Pines Nature Sanctuary, the Keweenaw Rocket Range, and Brockway Mountain Drive. I didn’t go to any of these.Some of these are challenging to access, down narrow or dirt roads.There are also miles of hiking, Mountain Biking, and ATV trails.Fort WilkinsIn 1844, the federal government and the US Army built Fort Wilkins to help maintain law and order during the copper rush. But it only operated for a couple of years because there wasn’t as much conflict as anticipated.It was abandoned in 1870, and became a Michigan State Park in 1923.At the entrance to the fort, near the visitor center, you can see some pits dug during the copper mining period.You can find the old cemetery near the main parking lot.There are 19 buildings, with 12 of them original log and frame structures.You can see interactive museum exhibits, including audio visual programs, and possibly costumed workers that allow visitors to see the daily routines and way of life at the fort.Are pets allowed at Fort Wilkins?You can bring your leashed pet into Fort Wilkins State Park. The only area I saw no dogs allowed signs were near the old cemeteryHow much does it cost to get into Fort Wilkins State Park?If you enter on foot, it’s free. However, if you come by  car or RV, You will also need to have, or purchase, a Michigan State Park Pass for each vehicle you have with you.  I purchased a non resident pass for $40 and paid $8 per stay for my towed vehicle. If I were staying in more than 5 state parks, it would have made sense to buy another non resident pass for my Jeep, too.There is a large parking lot with plenty of parking for all sizes of RVs and vehicles.Where did I stay in Copper Harbor?I stayed at the Fort Wilkins State Park, right next to Fort Wilkins historic site.You will definitely need to have a reservation instead of just showing up and hoping to find a site for a night or two.Book your campsite as far in advance as possible. I had no trouble finding a site four months in advance, but it was fully booked while I was there.When I was there, the west loop was closed for renovation, due to reopen in spring of 2025 with new bathhouses, so half of the sites in the campground were unavailable.The 50 amp, larger sites are in the west loop.You will also need to have, or to purchase, that Michigan State Park Pass to park your vehicles in the campground.The site I was on had 30 amp electric, and water, but no sewer. There was a dump station and a place to fill your tanks with potable water.The restrooms were very clean, with private showersThe sites on the east side were tight. I was able to back my tow dolly in and disconnect, but to get my car back on the dolly, I drove the RV over to the Fort Wilkins historic site parking area, then walked back and got my Jeep. They have a great camp store where you can get firewood and other camping related items.I was one of the larger RVs in the park, at just 27 feet. I did notice a lot of larger rigs driving into the campground, and then they just kept going when they realized they weren’t going to fit into any of the available sites because they were too big.I was not able to look at the sites on the west side, but if you have a rig over 30 to 35 feet, check the west side to see if it is more accommodating for you.My ATT and TMobile hot spots did not work well. I was able to watch TV at night, but I had to hang out by the restrooms or the post office in town to check my email, and even text!Is Copper Harbor worth going to?Fort Wilkins Historic State Park and Copper Harbor are definitely worth visiting! It is very remote, and the town is very small, but very picturesque and you do feel like you are in the middle of nowhere.If you have any comments, suggestions or questions about my trip to Copper Harbor or Fort Wilkins State Park, or if you would like to know when I publish a new blog post,you can message me here.Click here to watch the YouTube video!Thanks for joining me and check out some of my other RV and lifestyle posts as I continue this full-time RV life.Your privacy is important to us, and we do not share your information.

I had no trouble finding a site four months in advance, but it was fully booked while I was there.When I was there, the west loop was closed for renovation, due to reopen in spring of 2025 with new bathhouses, so half of the sites in the campground were unavailable.The 50 amp, larger sites are in the west loop.You will also need to have, or to purchase, that Michigan State Park Pass to park your vehicles in the campground.The site I was on had 30 amp electric, and water, but no sewer. There was a dump station and a place to fill your tanks with potable water.The restrooms were very clean, with private showersThe sites on the east side were tight. I was able to back my tow dolly in and disconnect, but to get my car back on the dolly, I drove the RV over to the Fort Wilkins historic site parking area, then walked back and got my Jeep. They have a great camp store where you can get firewood and other camping related items.I was one of the larger RVs in the park, at just 27 feet. I did notice a lot of larger rigs driving into the campground, and then they just kept going when they realized they weren’t going to fit into any of the available sites because they were too big.I was not able to look at the sites on the west side, but if you have a rig over 30 to 35 feet, check the west side to see if it is more accommodating for you.My ATT and TMobile hot spots did not work well. I was able to watch TV at night, but I had to hang out by the restrooms or the post office in town to check my email, and even text!",

Thanks for your support.Today I want to get real with you all about how living in this RV for the past two years has fundamentally changed who I am as a person.If you're new here, about two years ago, I decided to sell most of my possessions, buy this RV, and hit the road. At the time, I thought it would be a fun adventure, maybe something I'd do for a few years before returning to \"normal\" life. Little did I know that this lifestyle would completely transform my perspective on what \"normal\" even means.Today, I'm going to share the biggest ways RV life has changed me - from my relationship with material possessions to how I view community, from my daily habits to my long-term goals. So grab a cup of coffee, get comfortable, and let's dive in!Hey friends, welcome back to my blog! If you’re new here, I’m Nancy, and I’ve been living full-time in my RV for the pasttwo yearsnow. Two years of adventure, campgrounds, unexpected breakdowns, breathtaking sunsets—and a whole lot of personal growth.Materialism, Possessions and DownsizingThe first and perhaps most obvious way RV life has changed me is my relationship with stuff. When you live in under 200 square feet, every item you own needs to earn its place.Before I moved into the RV, I had a three-bedroom home filled with furniture, decorations, kitchen gadgets, clothes I rarely wore - you name it. I was constantly buying things I thought would make me happy or impress others. Shopping was literally a hobby.The process of downsizing was really painful at first. I remember sitting surrounded by all my belongings, trying to decide what was essential enough to bring into my new, tiny space. Each item represented money spent, a memory, or part of my identity. Letting go felt like losing pieces of myself.But here's the thing - once those items were gone, I rarely missed them. In fact, I felt lighter. The mental burden of maintaining, organizing, and worrying about all that stuff disappeared.Now, I follow a simple rule: one thing in, one thing out. Before I buy anything, I ask myself three questions:Do I truly need this?Where will it live in the RV?What value will it add to my life?This mindset has saved me thousands of dollars. More importantly, it's freed me from the constant cycle of consumption that our society normalizes. I've realized that experiences and relationships bring me far more joy than any possession ever could.The irony is that by having less, I feel like I have so much more. More freedom, more time, more mental space. I'm no longer defined by what I own, but by how I live.You can read more about my\"downsizing journey\" here.What Is \"Enough\"?One of the most profound shifts in my thinking has been redefining what \"enough\" means in my life. Before RV life, I was caught in what I now recognize as an endless pursuit of more - more money, more space, more stuff, more achievements, more validation.Our culture conditions us to believe that we never quite have enough. Advertisements, and sometimes friends, tell us we need the newest phone or fashion trends that change every season, and social media shows us bigger houses and more luxurious vacations that make our own lives seem inadequate by comparison.Living in an RV forced me to confront this mindset head-on. When your entire home is 200 square feet, you quickly learn what \"enough\" truly looks like for you personally.I've discovered that my \"enough\" is remarkably simple. Clean water, nutritious food, a comfortable place to sleep, good health, meaningful work, beautiful surroundings, and genuine connections with others. That's it. That's what truly contributes to my happiness and wellbeing.What's been fascinating is realizing how many things I thought I needed were actually just wants, often influenced by external pressures. The distinction between needs and wants has now become crystal clear.This redefinition of \"enough\" has been incredibly liberating. When you know what's truly enough for you, you stop chasing what others think you should want. You become immune to FOMO - the fear of missing out. You find contentment in what you have rather than anxiety about what you don't.I no longer feel the need to upgrade perfectly functional items. I don't feel inadequate when I see others with more expensive possessions. I don't measure my worth by my salary or title or address.There's a quote that's become something of a mantra for me: \"The secret to happiness is not in having more, but in wanting less.\" Two years of RV life has shown me the profound truth in those words.That's not to say I don't still have goals and aspirations. But now they’re more aligned with my authentic values rather than society's expectations. I pursue personal growth and new experiences rather than the accumulation of stuff and status. And I recognize when I have enough - enough stuff, enough activity, enough work - and allow myself to enjoy that place of sufficiency.Slowing Down and Enjoying LifeWhen I first hit the road, I was in hustle mode. I wanted to seeeverything.I was booking back-to-back sites, moving every few days. But somewhere around month six, I realized… I was still living in that rushed mindset I had in my old life.Closely tied to redefining \"enough\" has been learning to slow down and truly savor life. Before RV life, I was constantly rushing - rushing to work, rushing through meals, rushing through weekends to prepare for Monday. My calendar was packed with commitments, usually work commitments, and \"rest\" was something I scheduled between productive activities.RV life forced me to break that cycle. When you're not tied to a conventional job schedule or social obligations, you start to question why you were always in such a hurry. I'm learning to structure my days around natural rhythms instead of artificial deadlines.I now give myself permission to spend an entire morning taking my dogs for a walk or reading a book by a lake. I've stayed an extra week in places simply because I wasn't done enjoying them yet. I cook simpler meals slowly, savoring the process rather than just the result.This slower pace has made me more mindful. I notice details I would have missed before - the way the scenery changes as I travel, the patterns of stars, stopping to watch and listen to birds as they go about their days, or searching for the Northern Lights in the middle of the night with a compass and my Iphone. I appreciate small pleasures more intensely - a hot shower after days of boondocking, the perfect cup of coffee in the morning, a conversation with a stranger that turns into friendship.Slowing down has also allowed me more time for spontaneity. The opportunity to enjoy unexpected time with people, and to explore new places and things that weren't necessarily on my \"itinerary\". It's given me back the joy of being spontaneous that I thought I had lost a long time ago. The joy of a less structured lifestyle.Many times, I'll be feeling sorry for myself and wondering how I will fill the entire day ahead of me, and I'll get a text or phone call with a request to get out of the house for a while and do something fun, which is productive in it's own right, as it helps to clear my head. Unplanned spontaneity.I've learned to say yes more instead always saying no because I was too busy or too tired.The most surprising thing about giving myself permission to slow down is how much more productive it's made me in the areas that truly matter. When I do work, I'm more focused. When I create, I'm more inspired. When I connect with others, I'm more present. By doing less overall, I'm doing what matters better.There's a quote I think about often: \"Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished.\" Living close to nature has taught me the wisdom in these words. I've realized that many of my previous deadlines and time pressures were self-imposed or societally constructed, not actual necessities.Don't get me wrong - RV life isn't all peaceful sunsets and lazy mornings. There are stressful days and real responsibilities. But I've developed the ability to determine what genuinely deserves my urgency and what can unfold at its own pace. That discernment has been one of the greatest gifts. My nervous system thanks me daily.My Relationship With NatureLiving in an RV has completely transformed my relationship with the natural world. Before, nature was something I occasionally visited - a weekend hike here, a trip to the beach there. Now, it's my backdrop, my neighborhood, my constant companion.I've parked overlooking oceans, mountains, deserts, and forests. I've watched the sun rise over the ocean and set over the gulf. I've fallen asleep to the sound of rain on the roof and woken up to deer grazing outside my window.This proximity to nature has made me more aware of its rhythms. I notice the phases of the moon now. I can read weather patterns. I understand how the position of the sun affects the temperature inside my home. These aren't things I ever thought about in my house.I've also become much more environmentally conscious. When you physically carry your water in and your waste out, you develop a visceral understanding of consumption. I'm acutely aware of how much water I use when showering,  how much trash I generate, and how much electricity my appliances consume.My carbon footprint has decreased dramatically, not just because I live in a smaller space that requires less energy to heat and cool, but because my entire lifestyle has shifted. I buy less, waste less, and think more about my impact.This connection to nature has become central to my identity. I feel a responsibility to protect these beautiful places that have become my temporary homes. And I find myself gravitating toward other people who share this value.I'm More In Tune With MyselfRV life stripped away a lot of the noise. No more office commutes, no packed schedules. It’s just me, nature, and a lot of quiet.I’ve had time to reflect, journal, meditate, heal and even cry. Living in nature has grounded me in a way I never expected.I’ve learned who I really am without all the external pressures. And I've found that I like her a lot.Community and RelationshipsOne of the biggest misconceptions about RV life is that it's isolating or lonely. My experience has been the exact opposite. I've found a type of community I never had in my stationary life, where I could go days without any meaningful interaction with neighbors.The RV community is unlike anything I've experienced before. There's an instant connection, a shared understanding. We help each other back into tight spots, share tips about boondocking locations, loan tools, and celebrate holidays and birthdays together.What's unique about these relationships is their intensity and fluidity. You might meet someone, become fast friends for a week while parked at the same campground, then part ways - only to reunite months later in a completely different state.I've learned to be more open, to form connections quickly, and to be comfortable with temporary relationships. At the same time, I've maintained deeper friendships with a handful of RVers whose travel patterns sometimes align with mine.As for my relationships with family and old friends, those have evolved too. The distance can be challenging, but when we do connect, it's intentional and meaningful. Technology helps - I video chat regularly with my family and close friends. And when I do visit in person, I'm fully present, knowing our time together is limited.RV life has taught me that community isn't defined by proximity or permanence. It's about genuine connection, mutual support, and shared values, regardless of how long it lasts.Flexibility and AdaptabilityIf there's one skill you develop quickly in RV life, it's adaptability. When you live on the road, plans change constantly - sometimes by choice, sometimes by necessity.I've had to reroute due to wildfires, find last-minute accommodations during mechanical breakdowns, and adapt to unexpected weather. I've learned to troubleshoot everything from plumbing issues to electrical problems. I've become my own handyman, meteorologist, and travel agent.Before RV life, I was someone who liked control and predictability. I'd get anxious when things didn't go according to plan. Now, I expect the unexpected. I build buffer days into my schedule. I always have backup options.This adaptability has spilled over into all areas of my life. I'm more resilient, more resourceful, and less rattled by challenges. I've developed what I call \"productive patience\" - the ability to wait out difficulties while taking whatever constructive action I can.Living this way has also made me more present. When plans are fluid and tomorrow's location might change, you learn to appreciate where you are right now. I no longer rush through experiences just to get to the next thing on my schedule.Perhaps most importantly, I've learned that most problems aren't as catastrophic as they seem in the moment. A breakdown that strands you for three days becomes a funny story later. A route change due to weather might lead to discovering your new favorite place.Seeing the World DifferentlyWhen you live on the road, you see howdifferentevery little pocket of the country is. The people, the accents, the landscapes, even the grocery stores!I’ve talked to people from all over the country, and the world! It’s made me more open-minded, more curious, and way less judgmental.It turns out, we’ve all got more in common than we think.Financial MindsetLet's talk about money, because RV life has completely reconstructed my financial mindset. Contrary to what many assume, this lifestyle isn't necessarily cheaper than living in a house or apartment - it's just expensive in different ways.What's changed is how I think about spending, earning, and saving. Before, I was trapped in the traditional work-spend cycle. I worked to pay for my house, my car, my stuff... and I spent most of what I earned.Now, I've embraced what some call a \"minimum viable income\" approach. I've figured out exactly how much money I need to sustain my lifestyle, and I work just enough to meet that threshold, plus having savings for emergencies and future plans.This has meant developing location-independent income streams and being more intentional about when and how I work. Sometimes I'll intensely work for a few weeks in a place with good internet, then travel for a month with minimal work commitments.My spending priorities have shifted dramatically. I spend very little on household items or clothes, but I budget for experiences, national park passes, stays at campgrounds with amenities when I need them, and sometimes unique tours of places I get to visit. My biggest expenses are vehicle maintenance, fuel, and insurance - the costs of mobility.The financial freedom isn't about having more money - it's about needing less to be happy, and having more control over how I earn and spend what I do have. That's been incredibly empowering.Personal Identity and Future OutlookPerhaps the most profound change has been in how I see myself and my future. Before RV life, I was following a prescribed path - career advancement, home ownership, retirement savings. I measured success by conventional milestones.Two years on the road has completely dismantled that framework. I've had to redefine success on my own terms. What does achievement look like when you're not climbing a traditional career ladder? What does security mean when your home has wheels?I've discovered parts of myself I never knew existed. I'm more creative, more resourceful, more comfortable with uncertainty than I ever thought possible. I've developed new skills and interests simply because I've had to to save money or I’ve been exposed to different environments, experiences and people.As for the future, I honestly don't know if I'll live in an RV forever. And that's okay. This lifestyle has taught me that I don't need to have everything figured out. Plans can change. Homes can be temporary. Careers can evolve.What I do know is that I don’t want to go back to my old definition of \"normal.\" Whatever comes next - whether I continue traveling, settle somewhere part-time, or create some hybrid lifestyle - will be informed by what I've learned on the road.Two years of RV life has fundamentally changed me. From redefining what \"enough\" truly means to slowing down and savoring each day, from rethinking my relationship with possessions to finding new forms of community - this journey has transformed me in ways I never expected.Two years ago, I was nervous and excited and emotional and honestly hadno ideawhat I was getting into. But RV life has shaped me into a stronger, more grounded, moregratefulversion of myself.I'm not saying RV life is for everyone. It comes with real challenges real and sacrifices. But for me, those challenges have been worth it for the growth and perspective I've gained.I'd love to know what you think. Are you considering this lifestyle?

      "How RV Life Has Changed Me in the Past Two YearsWritten by Nancy Carter of Making My Own LaneThis article contains affiliate links. We will make a commission when you make a purchase at no cost to you, but it helps me buy gas ⛽️ for my travels! Thanks for your support.Today I want to get real with you all about how living in this RV for the past two years has fundamentally changed who I am as a person.If you're new here, about two years ago, I decided to sell most of my possessions, buy this RV, and hit the road. At the time, I thought it would be a fun adventure, maybe something I'd do for a few years before returning to \"normal\" life. Little did I know that this lifestyle would completely transform my perspective on what \"normal\" even means.Today, I'm going to share the biggest ways RV life has changed me - from my relationship with material possessions to how I view community, from my daily habits to my long-term goals. So grab a cup of coffee, get comfortable, and let's dive in!Hey friends, welcome back to my blog! If you’re new here, I’m Nancy, and I’ve been living full-time in my RV for the pasttwo yearsnow. Two years of adventure, campgrounds, unexpected breakdowns, breathtaking sunsets—and a whole lot of personal growth.Materialism, Possessions and DownsizingThe first and perhaps most obvious way RV life has changed me is my relationship with stuff. When you live in under 200 square feet, every item you own needs to earn its place.Before I moved into the RV, I had a three-bedroom home filled with furniture, decorations, kitchen gadgets, clothes I rarely wore - you name it. I was constantly buying things I thought would make me happy or impress others. Shopping was literally a hobby.The process of downsizing was really painful at first. I remember sitting surrounded by all my belongings, trying to decide what was essential enough to bring into my new, tiny space. Each item represented money spent, a memory, or part of my identity. Letting go felt like losing pieces of myself.But here's the thing - once those items were gone, I rarely missed them. In fact, I felt lighter. The mental burden of maintaining, organizing, and worrying about all that stuff disappeared.Now, I follow a simple rule: one thing in, one thing out. Before I buy anything, I ask myself three questions:Do I truly need this?Where will it live in the RV?What value will it add to my life?This mindset has saved me thousands of dollars. More importantly, it's freed me from the constant cycle of consumption that our society normalizes. I've realized that experiences and relationships bring me far more joy than any possession ever could.The irony is that by having less, I feel like I have so much more. More freedom, more time, more mental space. I'm no longer defined by what I own, but by how I live.You can read more about my\"downsizing journey\" here.What Is \"Enough\"?One of the most profound shifts in my thinking has been redefining what \"enough\" means in my life. Before RV life, I was caught in what I now recognize as an endless pursuit of more - more money, more space, more stuff, more achievements, more validation.Our culture conditions us to believe that we never quite have enough. Advertisements, and sometimes friends, tell us we need the newest phone or fashion trends that change every season, and social media shows us bigger houses and more luxurious vacations that make our own lives seem inadequate by comparison.Living in an RV forced me to confront this mindset head-on. When your entire home is 200 square feet, you quickly learn what \"enough\" truly looks like for you personally.I've discovered that my \"enough\" is remarkably simple. Clean water, nutritious food, a comfortable place to sleep, good health, meaningful work, beautiful surroundings, and genuine connections with others. That's it. That's what truly contributes to my happiness and wellbeing.What's been fascinating is realizing how many things I thought I needed were actually just wants, often influenced by external pressures. The distinction between needs and wants has now become crystal clear.This redefinition of \"enough\" has been incredibly liberating. When you know what's truly enough for you, you stop chasing what others think you should want. You become immune to FOMO - the fear of missing out. You find contentment in what you have rather than anxiety about what you don't.I no longer feel the need to upgrade perfectly functional items. I don't feel inadequate when I see others with more expensive possessions. I don't measure my worth by my salary or title or address.There's a quote that's become something of a mantra for me: \"The secret to happiness is not in having more, but in wanting less.\" Two years of RV life has shown me the profound truth in those words.That's not to say I don't still have goals and aspirations. But now they’re more aligned with my authentic values rather than society's expectations. I pursue personal growth and new experiences rather than the accumulation of stuff and status. And I recognize when I have enough - enough stuff, enough activity, enough work - and allow myself to enjoy that place of sufficiency.Slowing Down and Enjoying LifeWhen I first hit the road, I was in hustle mode. I wanted to seeeverything.I was booking back-to-back sites, moving every few days. But somewhere around month six, I realized… I was still living in that rushed mindset I had in my old life.Closely tied to redefining \"enough\" has been learning to slow down and truly savor life. Before RV life, I was constantly rushing - rushing to work, rushing through meals, rushing through weekends to prepare for Monday. My calendar was packed with commitments, usually work commitments, and \"rest\" was something I scheduled between productive activities.RV life forced me to break that cycle. When you're not tied to a conventional job schedule or social obligations, you start to question why you were always in such a hurry. I'm learning to structure my days around natural rhythms instead of artificial deadlines.I now give myself permission to spend an entire morning taking my dogs for a walk or reading a book by a lake. I've stayed an extra week in places simply because I wasn't done enjoying them yet. I cook simpler meals slowly, savoring the process rather than just the result.This slower pace has made me more mindful. I notice details I would have missed before - the way the scenery changes as I travel, the patterns of stars, stopping to watch and listen to birds as they go about their days, or searching for the Northern Lights in the middle of the night with a compass and my Iphone. I appreciate small pleasures more intensely - a hot shower after days of boondocking, the perfect cup of coffee in the morning, a conversation with a stranger that turns into friendship.Slowing down has also allowed me more time for spontaneity. The opportunity to enjoy unexpected time with people, and to explore new places and things that weren't necessarily on my \"itinerary\". It's given me back the joy of being spontaneous that I thought I had lost a long time ago. The joy of a less structured lifestyle.Many times, I'll be feeling sorry for myself and wondering how I will fill the entire day ahead of me, and I'll get a text or phone call with a request to get out of the house for a while and do something fun, which is productive in it's own right, as it helps to clear my head. Unplanned spontaneity.I've learned to say yes more instead always saying no because I was too busy or too tired.The most surprising thing about giving myself permission to slow down is how much more productive it's made me in the areas that truly matter. When I do work, I'm more focused. When I create, I'm more inspired. When I connect with others, I'm more present. By doing less overall, I'm doing what matters better.There's a quote I think about often: \"Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished.\" Living close to nature has taught me the wisdom in these words. I've realized that many of my previous deadlines and time pressures were self-imposed or societally constructed, not actual necessities.Don't get me wrong - RV life isn't all peaceful sunsets and lazy mornings. There are stressful days and real responsibilities. But I've developed the ability to determine what genuinely deserves my urgency and what can unfold at its own pace. That discernment has been one of the greatest gifts. My nervous system thanks me daily.My Relationship With NatureLiving in an RV has completely transformed my relationship with the natural world. Before, nature was something I occasionally visited - a weekend hike here, a trip to the beach there. Now, it's my backdrop, my neighborhood, my constant companion.I've parked overlooking oceans, mountains, deserts, and forests. I've watched the sun rise over the ocean and set over the gulf. I've fallen asleep to the sound of rain on the roof and woken up to deer grazing outside my window.This proximity to nature has made me more aware of its rhythms. I notice the phases of the moon now. I can read weather patterns. I understand how the position of the sun affects the temperature inside my home. These aren't things I ever thought about in my house.I've also become much more environmentally conscious. When you physically carry your water in and your waste out, you develop a visceral understanding of consumption. I'm acutely aware of how much water I use when showering,  how much trash I generate, and how much electricity my appliances consume.My carbon footprint has decreased dramatically, not just because I live in a smaller space that requires less energy to heat and cool, but because my entire lifestyle has shifted. I buy less, waste less, and think more about my impact.This connection to nature has become central to my identity. I feel a responsibility to protect these beautiful places that have become my temporary homes. And I find myself gravitating toward other people who share this value.I'm More In Tune With MyselfRV life stripped away a lot of the noise. No more office commutes, no packed schedules. It’s just me, nature, and a lot of quiet.I’ve had time to reflect, journal, meditate, heal and even cry. Living in nature has grounded me in a way I never expected.I’ve learned who I really am without all the external pressures. And I've found that I like her a lot.Community and RelationshipsOne of the biggest misconceptions about RV life is that it's isolating or lonely. My experience has been the exact opposite. I've found a type of community I never had in my stationary life, where I could go days without any meaningful interaction with neighbors.The RV community is unlike anything I've experienced before. There's an instant connection, a shared understanding. We help each other back into tight spots, share tips about boondocking locations, loan tools, and celebrate holidays and birthdays together.What's unique about these relationships is their intensity and fluidity. You might meet someone, become fast friends for a week while parked at the same campground, then part ways - only to reunite months later in a completely different state.I've learned to be more open, to form connections quickly, and to be comfortable with temporary relationships. At the same time, I've maintained deeper friendships with a handful of RVers whose travel patterns sometimes align with mine.As for my relationships with family and old friends, those have evolved too. The distance can be challenging, but when we do connect, it's intentional and meaningful. Technology helps - I video chat regularly with my family and close friends. And when I do visit in person, I'm fully present, knowing our time together is limited.RV life has taught me that community isn't defined by proximity or permanence. It's about genuine connection, mutual support, and shared values, regardless of how long it lasts.Flexibility and AdaptabilityIf there's one skill you develop quickly in RV life, it's adaptability. When you live on the road, plans change constantly - sometimes by choice, sometimes by necessity.I've had to reroute due to wildfires, find last-minute accommodations during mechanical breakdowns, and adapt to unexpected weather. I've learned to troubleshoot everything from plumbing issues to electrical problems. I've become my own handyman, meteorologist, and travel agent.Before RV life, I was someone who liked control and predictability. I'd get anxious when things didn't go according to plan. Now, I expect the unexpected. I build buffer days into my schedule. I always have backup options.This adaptability has spilled over into all areas of my life. I'm more resilient, more resourceful, and less rattled by challenges. I've developed what I call \"productive patience\" - the ability to wait out difficulties while taking whatever constructive action I can.Living this way has also made me more present. When plans are fluid and tomorrow's location might change, you learn to appreciate where you are right now. I no longer rush through experiences just to get to the next thing on my schedule.Perhaps most importantly, I've learned that most problems aren't as catastrophic as they seem in the moment. A breakdown that strands you for three days becomes a funny story later. A route change due to weather might lead to discovering your new favorite place.Seeing the World DifferentlyWhen you live on the road, you see howdifferentevery little pocket of the country is. The people, the accents, the landscapes, even the grocery stores!I’ve talked to people from all over the country, and the world! It’s made me more open-minded, more curious, and way less judgmental.It turns out, we’ve all got more in common than we think.Financial MindsetLet's talk about money, because RV life has completely reconstructed my financial mindset. Contrary to what many assume, this lifestyle isn't necessarily cheaper than living in a house or apartment - it's just expensive in different ways.What's changed is how I think about spending, earning, and saving. Before, I was trapped in the traditional work-spend cycle. I worked to pay for my house, my car, my stuff... and I spent most of what I earned.Now, I've embraced what some call a \"minimum viable income\" approach. I've figured out exactly how much money I need to sustain my lifestyle, and I work just enough to meet that threshold, plus having savings for emergencies and future plans.This has meant developing location-independent income streams and being more intentional about when and how I work. Sometimes I'll intensely work for a few weeks in a place with good internet, then travel for a month with minimal work commitments.My spending priorities have shifted dramatically. I spend very little on household items or clothes, but I budget for experiences, national park passes, stays at campgrounds with amenities when I need them, and sometimes unique tours of places I get to visit. My biggest expenses are vehicle maintenance, fuel, and insurance - the costs of mobility.The financial freedom isn't about having more money - it's about needing less to be happy, and having more control over how I earn and spend what I do have. That's been incredibly empowering.Personal Identity and Future OutlookPerhaps the most profound change has been in how I see myself and my future.

My calendar was packed with commitments, usually work commitments, and \"rest\" was something I scheduled between productive activities.RV life forced me to break that cycle. When you're not tied to a conventional job schedule or social obligations, you start to question why you were always in such a hurry. I'm learning to structure my days around natural rhythms instead of artificial deadlines.I now give myself permission to spend an entire morning taking my dogs for a walk or reading a book by a lake. I've stayed an extra week in places simply because I wasn't done enjoying them yet. I cook simpler meals slowly, savoring the process rather than just the result.This slower pace has made me more mindful. I notice details I would have missed before - the way the scenery changes as I travel, the patterns of stars, stopping to watch and listen to birds as they go about their days, or searching for the Northern Lights in the middle of the night with a compass and my Iphone. I appreciate small pleasures more intensely - a hot shower after days of boondocking, the perfect cup of coffee in the morning, a conversation with a stranger that turns into friendship.Slowing down has also allowed me more time for spontaneity. The opportunity to enjoy unexpected time with people, and to explore new places and things that weren't necessarily on my \"itinerary\". It's given me back the joy of being spontaneous that I thought I had lost a long time ago. The joy of a less structured lifestyle.Many times, I'll be feeling sorry for myself and wondering how I will fill the entire day ahead of me, and I'll get a text or phone call with a request to get out of the house for a while and do something fun, which is productive in it's own right, as it helps to clear my head. Unplanned spontaneity.I've learned to say yes more instead always saying no because I was too busy or too tired.The most surprising thing about giving myself permission to slow down is how much more productive it's made me in the areas that truly matter. When I do work, I'm more focused. When I create, I'm more inspired. When I connect with others, I'm more present. By doing less overall, I'm doing what matters better.There's a quote I think about often: \"Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished.\" Living close to nature has taught me the wisdom in these words. I've realized that many of my previous deadlines and time pressures were self-imposed or societally constructed, not actual necessities.Don't get me wrong - RV life isn't all peaceful sunsets and lazy mornings. There are stressful days and real responsibilities. But I've developed the ability to determine what genuinely deserves my urgency and what can unfold at its own pace. That discernment has been one of the greatest gifts. My nervous system thanks me daily.",

      "Living in an RV has completely transformed my relationship with the natural world. Before, nature was something I occasionally visited - a weekend hike here, a trip to the beach there. Now, it's my backdrop, my neighborhood, my constant companion.I've parked overlooking oceans, mountains, deserts, and forests. I've watched the sun rise over the ocean and set over the gulf. I've fallen asleep to the sound of rain on the roof and woken up to deer grazing outside my window.This proximity to nature has made me more aware of its rhythms. I notice the phases of the moon now. I can read weather patterns. I understand how the position of the sun affects the temperature inside my home. These aren't things I ever thought about in my house.I've also become much more environmentally conscious. When you physically carry your water in and your waste out, you develop a visceral understanding of consumption. I'm acutely aware of how much water I use when showering,  how much trash I generate, and how much electricity my appliances consume.My carbon footprint has decreased dramatically, not just because I live in a smaller space that requires less energy to heat and cool, but because my entire lifestyle has shifted. I buy less, waste less, and think more about my impact.This connection to nature has become central to my identity. I feel a responsibility to protect these beautiful places that have become my temporary homes. And I find myself gravitating toward other people who share this value.",

      "One of the biggest misconceptions about RV life is that it's isolating or lonely. My experience has been the exact opposite. I've found a type of community I never had in my stationary life, where I could go days without any meaningful interaction with neighbors.The RV community is unlike anything I've experienced before. There's an instant connection, a shared understanding. We help each other back into tight spots, share tips about boondocking locations, loan tools, and celebrate holidays and birthdays together.What's unique about these relationships is their intensity and fluidity. You might meet someone, become fast friends for a week while parked at the same campground, then part ways - only to reunite months later in a completely different state.I've learned to be more open, to form connections quickly, and to be comfortable with temporary relationships. At the same time, I've maintained deeper friendships with a handful of RVers whose travel patterns sometimes align with mine.As for my relationships with family and old friends, those have evolved too. The distance can be challenging, but when we do connect, it's intentional and meaningful. Technology helps - I video chat regularly with my family and close friends. And when I do visit in person, I'm fully present, knowing our time together is limited.RV life has taught me that community isn't defined by proximity or permanence. It's about genuine connection, mutual support, and shared values, regardless of how long it lasts.",

      "If there's one skill you develop quickly in RV life, it's adaptability. When you live on the road, plans change constantly - sometimes by choice, sometimes by necessity.I've had to reroute due to wildfires, find last-minute accommodations during mechanical breakdowns, and adapt to unexpected weather. I've learned to troubleshoot everything from plumbing issues to electrical problems. I've become my own handyman, meteorologist, and travel agent.Before RV life, I was someone who liked control and predictability. I'd get anxious when things didn't go according to plan. Now, I expect the unexpected. I build buffer days into my schedule. I always have backup options.This adaptability has spilled over into all areas of my life. I'm more resilient, more resourceful, and less rattled by challenges. I've developed what I call \"productive patience\" - the ability to wait out difficulties while taking whatever constructive action I can.Living this way has also made me more present. When plans are fluid and tomorrow's location might change, you learn to appreciate where you are right now. I no longer rush through experiences just to get to the next thing on my schedule.Perhaps most importantly, I've learned that most problems aren't as catastrophic as they seem in the moment. A breakdown that strands you for three days becomes a funny story later. A route change due to weather might lead to discovering your new favorite place.",

      "Let's talk about money, because RV life has completely reconstructed my financial mindset. Contrary to what many assume, this lifestyle isn't necessarily cheaper than living in a house or apartment - it's just expensive in different ways.What's changed is how I think about spending, earning, and saving. Before, I was trapped in the traditional work-spend cycle. I worked to pay for my house, my car, my stuff... and I spent most of what I earned.Now, I've embraced what some call a \"minimum viable income\" approach. I've figured out exactly how much money I need to sustain my lifestyle, and I work just enough to meet that threshold, plus having savings for emergencies and future plans.This has meant developing location-independent income streams and being more intentional about when and how I work. Sometimes I'll intensely work for a few weeks in a place with good internet, then travel for a month with minimal work commitments.My spending priorities have shifted dramatically. I spend very little on household items or clothes, but I budget for experiences, national park passes, stays at campgrounds with amenities when I need them, and sometimes unique tours of places I get to visit. My biggest expenses are vehicle maintenance, fuel, and insurance - the costs of mobility.The financial freedom isn't about having more money - it's about needing less to be happy, and having more control over how I earn and spend what I do have. That's been incredibly empowering.",

Starting out with tents, and moving into a pop-up camper when my daughters were younger.We had so many happy trips in the pop up.  Exploring Florida State Parks and camping at Disney Fort Wilderness for holidays and special occasions.Once my daughters moved out on their own, I bought a tent again, a couple of cots, and went camping maybe once a year.  It got harder to find time to get away, as my job got more demanding and the girls’ social schedules got busier.But it was always a dream to travel and explore more.Create an RV Wish List of Must Have Options.In December of 2022, I created my wish list of what I would want in an RV.  I had no desire to buy one, but one can dream, right?I had been watching a lot of YouTube videos about different types of rigs.  Originally I thought I would want a Class B, or van type of rig.  Then I thought maybe a small Class A would be better.  Until I finally settled on a Class C.  You know, the one that has that overhang over the cab.Here is my list.  I wrote it on December 1, 2022.  Remember the date.Class C with overhead bunkUsed25,000 to 40,000 milesBackup cameraOutside storage areasComposting toiletTires less than 2 years oldMaintenance recordsSolar equipped with lithium batteriesLots of outletsFord E450Outside awningWorking ACVery specific.  Close the book and never look at it again.Until December 2nd, 2022.I was watching YouTube (my favorite pastime), and this video came up with an RV for sale.A Class C, with a composting toilet, and lots of solar…Located in Florida, less than 2 hours from my house…I turned off the TV and let it go.  There was no way I could afford it.But I kept thinking about it, and on December 4th I watched the video again and checked out the FaceBook ad.  Sale pending.Of course.  But, I emailed the seller to let him know how much I admired his rig, and I asked him to contact me if the sale fell through.Which he did!So, we made plans for me to come and look, after I got back from a trip to visit my family in New Jersey.I got off the plane and went straight to his house, and fell in love with Daisy.Inspecting an RV before you buy it.When you buy a used RV, looking at it through those rose-colored glasses can be dangerous.  I asked him if it would be OK if I had someone come and do an inspection, and he said yes.I highly recommend doing this with anNRVIA certified inspector, whether you are buying a used or a brand new RV.  If the answer is no, run.Daisy checked out well.  I had a short list of things to look out for or fix.  And on December 20th, 2022 Daisy was mine.I have found in my life that writing my intentions and the things that I want down has a crazy power.  In fact, instead of New Year’s Resolutions, I have written down things I wanted to do or accomplish during the year, including buying a new roof or ac or taking a trip somewhere.Once I write them down, I don’t look at the list again until the following New Year’s Eve.  I am always amazed, looking at that list one year later, how much of that list can be checked off.How does it work?  I don’t know.  The power of intention?  The power of the written word?And it worked again for Daisy.  In record time, in a very strange way.Daisy came with a few things I hadn’t put on my list that have proven to be so helpful.Here's a great blog post from RVHelp.com,Questions to Ask When You are Buying a Used RV.When your roadside assistance just isn't enough, check out RV Help. It's like having an RV support person riding with you!Important RV options to consider.A mini split AC.With an air conditioner that takes a lot less energy that a traditional roof AC, and the 1640 watts of solar, I am able to leave my pets in the RV while I go into the grocery store, or take a day-trip where I am not hooked to power. It also allows me to stay overnight (or longer) without being hooked up.It also allows me to not have to hook up the RV immediately when I get to my destination. I can turn on the air and take the dogs for a walk.I can also run the fridge on solar power while I am driving, as well as my internet!Diesel engine.I don’t know a lot about engines, but I do have a lot of power when going up hills.Extensions on the dually tires, so that I can easily check the air pressure.  Some people hate them. I love them. (2025 update, after 2 years on the road, I amnota fan!)The 26.5 lengthmakes it easier for me to drive/park in smaller areas, especially since I am currently not using a toad, or tow vehicle. Basically, wherever I go, I need to bring my home.Why did I choose the items on my list? After thinking about the options for a long time, I will explain how I came to each decision.Class C- I didn’t want to tow anything. After years of towing a pop up, I didn’t want to deal with the hooking up and backing up. I knew I wanted to travel the country in this RV, and I wanted a “simple set up” - no slides and not too big, but larger than a van. I wanted a separate and dedicated bedroom area, a bathroom with a shower, and lots of windows for the beautiful views I planned on waking up to.Used- I wanted a camper that was “broken in”, and updated for real life living.25,000 to 40,000 miles- Daisy had 60,000 miles. That is really good, especially for a diesel engine.  Sometimes having too low miles isn't good.  Motor homes are meant to be driven to keep the fluids flowing.Backup camera- so I could back into sites easier.Outside storage areas- to store camping items needed, like chairs, leveling blocks, hoses, etc.Composting toilet- I really didn’t want to mess with a black tank. Yes, there is a learning curve, and the bucket does need to be cleaned. But I am amazed at how easy it is to clean and maintain.Tires less than 2 years old- with the cost of the RV, I didn’t want to have to invest in tires for a couple of years, especially since I now have 6 tires.Maintenance records- being able to see how well your RV was taken care of, and having a record of previous repairs and where they were done, as well as the original owner’s manual, is so helpful.Solar equipped with lithium batteries- Daisy has more solar than most. She is a beast! This has allowed me to camp in some places that would be difficult without power. It has proven really beneficial with pets. Having solar and a temperature monitoring system that I can check from my phone allows me to leave the camper but know that my fur babies are OK.This has helped, even hooked up to shore power! If the electricity goes out in the park (yes, that does happen), I don’t even notice and my AC stays on to keep them safe.Lots of outlets- I wanted a “smart” RV with a security system, which means lots of things to plug in, both 110 outlets and USB connections.  I also have a couple of 12V outlets, which I haven't had to use yet, but they are there.Ford E450- I like Ford, and wanted a powerful engine because I plan to travel across the country, AND (even more importantly), this rig is able to be worked on in a standard truck mechanic shop. I didn’t know or understand what this would mean, but when I needed new brakes and rotors, I was able to get it done in one day, in the truck shop. And the savings over having to bring it to an RV shop was considerable.You canread more about the unexpected RV repairs I had to makehere.Hint - find a good mechanic in your “home” area and create a relationship with them.Outside awning- important, but which I have yet to use.Working AC- living in Florida, not having AC is not an option,andA Kitty Door! -Because I planned on traveling with my dogs and a cat, I had been thinking about where I was going to put the kitty litter.  Daisy came with a cat door going into the bathroom, where I could keep the kitty litter in the shower, away from the dogs.  Perfect.If you already own an RV, what items were on your wishlist? Which ones were important, and which ones did you find not so important?Are you still in the dreaming phase? Think about how you plan on using your RV and then you can decided what options might be essential for you.If you are a full-time RVer and have any tips or suggestions on creating a wish list,leave a commenthere.To follow along with my travels, and learn about living in an RV full-time, please subscribe to the website.Thanks for reading!By submitting this form, you are consenting to receive emails from Making My Own Lane and Nancy Carter.

I wanted a separate and dedicated bedroom area, a bathroom with a shower, and lots of windows for the beautiful views I planned on waking up to.Used- I wanted a camper that was “broken in”, and updated for real life living.25,000 to 40,000 miles- Daisy had 60,000 miles. That is really good, especially for a diesel engine.  Sometimes having too low miles isn't good.  Motor homes are meant to be driven to keep the fluids flowing.Backup camera- so I could back into sites easier.Outside storage areas- to store camping items needed, like chairs, leveling blocks, hoses, etc.Composting toilet- I really didn’t want to mess with a black tank. Yes, there is a learning curve, and the bucket does need to be cleaned. But I am amazed at how easy it is to clean and maintain.Tires less than 2 years old- with the cost of the RV, I didn’t want to have to invest in tires for a couple of years, especially since I now have 6 tires.Maintenance records- being able to see how well your RV was taken care of, and having a record of previous repairs and where they were done, as well as the original owner’s manual, is so helpful.Solar equipped with lithium batteries- Daisy has more solar than most. She is a beast! This has allowed me to camp in some places that would be difficult without power. It has proven really beneficial with pets. Having solar and a temperature monitoring system that I can check from my phone allows me to leave the camper but know that my fur babies are OK.This has helped, even hooked up to shore power! If the electricity goes out in the park (yes, that does happen), I don’t even notice and my AC stays on to keep them safe.Lots of outlets- I wanted a “smart” RV with a security system, which means lots of things to plug in, both 110 outlets and USB connections.  I also have a couple of 12V outlets, which I haven't had to use yet, but they are there.Ford E450- I like Ford, and wanted a powerful engine because I plan to travel across the country, AND (even more importantly), this rig is able to be worked on in a standard truck mechanic shop. I didn’t know or understand what this would mean, but when I needed new brakes and rotors, I was able to get it done in one day, in the truck shop. And the savings over having to bring it to an RV shop was considerable.You canread more about the unexpected RV repairs I had to makehere.Hint - find a good mechanic in your “home” area and create a relationship with them.Outside awning- important, but which I have yet to use.Working AC- living in Florida, not having AC is not an option,andA Kitty Door! -Because I planned on traveling with my dogs and a cat, I had been thinking about where I was going to put the kitty litter.

      "Important RV options to consider.",
      "A mini split AC.With an air conditioner that takes a lot less energy that a traditional roof AC, and the 1640 watts of solar, I am able to leave my pets in the RV while I go into the grocery store, or take a day-trip where I am not hooked to power.

Maybe you’ve been dreaming of it for a while, or perhaps you’re just starting to explore the possibility. Full-time RV life can be an incredible adventure, but it’s also a big decision—one that requires some honest reflection.\n\nEspecially for women over 55, this lifestyle can represent a new chapter, one filled with freedom, flexibility, and the chance to explore new places at your own pace. However, it’s important to ask yourself the right questions before taking the plunge. So, if you’re wondering whether RV life is right for you, here are six key questions to reflect on before you make that big leap.",

Please see our full disclosurefor more information.Is RV Life Right for You?Today I'm going to offer you a few test questions for you to ask yourself and reflect on as you think about whether full-time RV living might be for you.While RV life is definitely right for me right now,  I do know people who tried it for a year. They gave it a fair shot and they decided it wasn't for them.Maybe it was too hard, too lonely or just too much work. but at least they tried. They're not going to look back on their life and 20 years and say I wish I'd done that, or what would have happened if I'd done that.I am going into my third year of RV life, and I would be lying to you if I told you I never thought about stopping - justread some of my other postsorwatch some of my YouTube videosto see some of the challenges that I have faced.Then there are other posts and videos that show you how amazing this life is. The “wow” moments, when you just sit and look out over a beautiful sunset, or a river, or a lake, and you just think “wow”.When you experience breathtakingly beautiful spots or when you meet new people that turn into friends or when you figure out a solution to something that you never even knew could be a problem until you started RV living, but you figure it out.And your confidence grows.I like to share the good and the bad and the average days. After all, I am not on vacation. This is my life. Complete with laundry grocery shopping, paying bills, babysitting for my granddaughter and dental appointments.So let's dive in.First, do you like to travel?I know that seems like a given, but do youreallylike to travel? Frequently?  Do you like to explore new places?  Are you okay with waking up and opening your front door to a new view every day?Right now I'm only moving every two to three weeks. I'm more stable for the winter, but there are times that I have moved every day for 5 to 7 days in a row. Or every 2 to three days for a month.That changes according to the weather,  my mood,  and the availability of campsites. Can I stay longer?  Can I leave earlier?Two: Are you a Risk Taker?Are you ready to take on an outside the box lifestyle that's different from a mainstream lifestyle?You do get some interesting looks living in an RV full-time. And it’s always a conversation starter.Almost all of the people I have met are of two different camps. One is, “Why would you ever ever sell your house and do that? And the other one is, “That is exactly what I want to do!”Three: Are you comfortable with living a minimalistic lifestyle?I still feel like I have all the comforts of home, and then some.  I'm just more aware of some of the creature comforts, like water and electricity.I also make changes regularly, as I get to know my RV and my camping style better.It's all based on making my life easier, more enjoyable,safer and less stressful.I have found that making these adjustments and changes is part of the fun. Finding solutions and then learning to fix some things on your own gives you a sense of accomplishment. Sometimes I even feel like a bit of a badass.Everyone is different, and with this lifestyle you have the flexibility and freedom making this life uniquely yours, without judgement from others in the RV community.I don't have a lot of room for stuff. Everything needs to have a place, and everything needs to be put back exactly where I found it, or I will never find it again.Everything has a purpose … maybe two or three purposes.As you camp in different places and areas of the country, you will find different situations and different solutions.I am constantly looking at what I have and purging.My goal for 2025 is tonotreplace things after I purge them just because I find I have extra room in my RV to put something.Learning to live with less is a journey all of its own.Four: Are you flexible, open to change, adaptable and resourceful?These are all important characteristics of someone who's living on the road full time.Finding your way around each new grocery store in different locations that you visit.Not being able to buy everything just because it's a good deal or on sale.Having safe water to drink for you, and your pets (if you have pets), and planning time at your home base area for doctor's appointments, catching up with family, dental visits, vet visits and keeping up with general business.The nice thing is, I can do it in the four months that I'm more stationary, and enjoy the other eight without really having to think about all the other stuff that much.Then there's figuring out how to get your mail and packages, and finding reliable internet at reasonable prices, or not having Internet.I've been lucky that my T-Mobile home and AT&T service on my cell phone with a hotspot that I can use has worked almost everywhere.But there are times and places it doesn’t.I've learned that instead of stressing out when there's no or low connectivity, to just enjoy where I am in the moment. Maybe read a book,   watch a movie that I've downloaded, or go out for a walk and just enjoy nature and the quiet of this lifestyle. Although I do enjoy it more when I'm connected.Five: Are You Prepared Financially for RV Life?RV livingmaybe less expensive than living in a house with a rent or a mortgage, but it's still not cheap, at least for me.Having an emergency fund for those unexpected repairs or medical bills is crucial.If you are thinking about hitting the road full time, and trying to figure out how much this lifestyle might cost you, get your own FREE RV Living Budget Calculatorhttps://makingmyownlane.com/rv-budget-worksheetand create your own, personal guesstimateIf you are thinking about hitting the road full time, and trying to figure out how much this lifestyle might cost you, get your ownFREE RV Living Budget Calculator  and create your own, personal guesstimateNumber Six: Practice Before You Start.Before I sold my house and almost everything in it, I did a test run or two or three.I had already chosen my RV, and I had bought that right before I quit my job, thinking that I would just use my RV for weekends and travel with friends.If you are not surehow to choose your first RV, read this blog post.I started with a one-week trip kind of close to home. Then I did a 4-week trip a little farther away from home.And when, after 4 weeks, I realized I still didn't want to go home, that's when I started to think that this life could be for me.Once I went full-time, the first year I traveled to places that I was very familiar with and where I had friends or family along the way, in case I needed help.The second year I was pretty much on my own. I learned a lot and I got to see a lot of great places and meet a lot of new people, but it was completely different for me.Next year is going to be the biggest adventure, as I go out west, where I've never been for any length of time, let alone in an RV.It's going to be a bigger and longer journey than ever.My goal was to travel the US in my RV for five years. I take it one year one year, one trip at a time.In my corporate world life, I always had a month plan, a year plan, a five year, even a 10 year plan.I love that I've been able to relax and let that go, and just enjoy where I am in the moment.Now I live year-to-year, taking life one campground at a time and enjoying the uniqueness and the opportunities that every place I stop has to offer.If you're finding the information in this blog post helpful as you consider possibly starting your own RV life and deciding if this might be for you, please join the friends of Making My Own Lane community and share this with friends or family.You can subscribe below for updates as we travel, or leave a commenthere.Your privacy is important to us, and we do not share your information.

Everything needs to have a place, and everything needs to be put back exactly where I found it, or I will never find it again.Everything has a purpose … maybe two or three purposes.As you camp in different places and areas of the country, you will find different situations and different solutions.I am constantly looking at what I have and purging.My goal for 2025 is tonotreplace things after I purge them just because I find I have extra room in my RV to put something.Learning to live with less is a journey all of its own.Four: Are you flexible, open to change, adaptable and resourceful?These are all important characteristics of someone who's living on the road full time.Finding your way around each new grocery store in different locations that you visit.Not being able to buy everything just because it's a good deal or on sale.Having safe water to drink for you, and your pets (if you have pets), and planning time at your home base area for doctor's appointments, catching up with family, dental visits, vet visits and keeping up with general business.The nice thing is, I can do it in the four months that I'm more stationary, and enjoy the other eight without really having to think about all the other stuff that much.Then there's figuring out how to get your mail and packages, and finding reliable internet at reasonable prices, or not having Internet.I've been lucky that my T-Mobile home and AT&T service on my cell phone with a hotspot that I can use has worked almost everywhere.But there are times and places it doesn’t.I've learned that instead of stressing out when there's no or low connectivity, to just enjoy where I am in the moment. Maybe read a book,   watch a movie that I've downloaded, or go out for a walk and just enjoy nature and the quiet of this lifestyle. Although I do enjoy it more when I'm connected.Five: Are You Prepared Financially for RV Life?RV livingmaybe less expensive than living in a house with a rent or a mortgage, but it's still not cheap, at least for me.Having an emergency fund for those unexpected repairs or medical bills is crucial.If you are thinking about hitting the road full time, and trying to figure out how much this lifestyle might cost you, get your own FREE RV Living Budget Calculatorhttps://makingmyownlane.com/rv-budget-worksheetand create your own, personal guesstimateIf you are thinking about hitting the road full time, and trying to figure out how much this lifestyle might cost you, get your ownFREE RV Living Budget Calculator  and create your own, personal guesstimateNumber Six: Practice Before You Start.Before I sold my house and almost everything in it, I did a test run or two or three.I had already chosen my RV, and I had bought that right before I quit my job, thinking that I would just use my RV for weekends and travel with friends.If you are not surehow to choose your first RV, read this blog post.I started with a one-week trip kind of close to home. Then I did a 4-week trip a little farther away from home.And when, after 4 weeks, I realized I still didn't want to go home, that's when I started to think that this life could be for me.Once I went full-time, the first year I traveled to places that I was very familiar with and where I had friends or family along the way, in case I needed help.The second year I was pretty much on my own. I learned a lot and I got to see a lot of great places and meet a lot of new people, but it was completely different for me.Next year is going to be the biggest adventure, as I go out west, where I've never been for any length of time, let alone in an RV.It's going to be a bigger and longer journey than ever.My goal was to travel the US in my RV for five years. I take it one year one year, one trip at a time.In my corporate world life, I always had a month plan, a year plan, a five year, even a 10 year plan.I love that I've been able to relax and let that go, and just enjoy where I am in the moment.Now I live year-to-year, taking life one campground at a time and enjoying the uniqueness and the opportunities that every place I stop has to offer.If you're finding the information in this blog post helpful as you consider possibly starting your own RV life and deciding if this might be for you, please join the friends of Making My Own Lane community and share this with friends or family.You can subscribe below for updates as we travel, or leave a commenthere.Your privacy is important to us, and we do not share your information.

They're not going to look back on their life and 20 years and say I wish I'd done that, or what would have happened if I'd done that.I am going into my third year of RV life, and I would be lying to you if I told you I never thought about stopping - justread some of my other postsorwatch some of my YouTube videosto see some of the challenges that I have faced.Then there are other posts and videos that show you how amazing this life is. The “wow” moments, when you just sit and look out over a beautiful sunset, or a river, or a lake, and you just think “wow”.When you experience breathtakingly beautiful spots or when you meet new people that turn into friends or when you figure out a solution to something that you never even knew could be a problem until you started RV living, but you figure it out.And your confidence grows.I like to share the good and the bad and the average days. After all, I am not on vacation. This is my life. Complete with laundry grocery shopping, paying bills, babysitting for my granddaughter and dental appointments.So let's dive in.",

Thanks for your support.How to Keep Your RV Cool This SummerToday we're tackling one of the biggest challenges of RV life – keeping your RV cool when temperatures soar outside.If you've spent any time living or traveling in an RV during summer months, you know exactly what I'm talking about. That greenhouse effect is real! These metal and fiberglass boxes we call home can heat up FAST, turning your cozy space into an unbearable sauna in no time.But here's the good news – after three summers of full-time RV living in arguably the hottest and most humid region in the country, Florida, I've figured out a comprehensive cooling strategy that works. And the game-changer in my setup? My Dr. Prepare 10,000 BTU portable air conditioner with WIFI.I'm going to share everything I've learned about staying cool in an RV, with a special focus on how to maximize the efficiency of a portable AC unit that's been absolutely essential for my comfort. We'll cover installation, optimization, maintenance, and combine it with other heat-beating strategies to create a comprehensive cooling system for your RV.Understanding RV Cooling ChallengesWhen I was thinking about spending May, June, July and some of August in Florida this summer, I knew I had to find a solution to staying cool in my RV,For the past 2 years, I swore I would never be in Florida after Memorial Day, and even that’s pushing it with the heat. And I have headed north in search of cooler temps.But this year, I really wanted to stay in Florida and travel to some very hot Florida destinations that are more difficult to get into when it starts to cool off in the rest of the country.So, in January, after some research, I decided to purchase the Dr. Prepare portable AC unit and test it out.Before we talk solutions, let's understand the problem.RVs heat up much faster than traditional homes for several reasons:First, they have less insulation. Most RVs simply don't have the thick walls and insulation of standard houses. Even the best-built RVs typically have thinner walls with less space for insulative material.Second, they have proportionally more windows relative to their size. While windows are great for natural light and views, they're terrible for temperature regulation. They let in massive amounts of solar heat and offer minimal insulation.My double-paned windows help, but a Lazy Dazes RV has the biggest windows all around, to allow for amazing panoramic views, and let a lot of heat and cold in.Third, RVs are often made with metal exteriors, which conduct heat extraordinarily well. That aluminum skin that makes your rig lightweight enough to tow? It's also excellent at transferring outside heat indoors.To make matters worse, many RVs come with rooftop air conditioners that, frankly, aren't always up to the task – especially when you're boondocking without hookups or dealing with extreme temperatures.I've recorded temperatures of over 100°F inside my RV when it was only 85°F outside! And that's WITH reflective window coverings and vents open for airflow.This is where supplemental cooling becomes essential. The Dr. Prepare portable air conditioner has been my solution of choice because it's:Compact enough for RV spacesPowerful enough to make a real differenceEnergy-efficient enough to run on many power setupsVersatile enough to move around as needed on travel days.Let's take a closer look at this unit and how to integrate it into your RV cooling strategy.The Dr. Prepare Portable AC unitTheDr. Prepare portable air conditioneris specifically designed for smaller spaces, making it ideal for RVs. Here are the key specs you should know:Cooling capacity: 8,000 BTUs, but there are other sizes available for larger rigsDimensions: 12.4 inches wide, 12.2 inches deep and 27 and a half inches high.Weight: Approximately 45 poundsPower consumption: 780 wattsFeatures: Digital controls, remote operation, multiple fan speeds, programmable timerAdditional functions: Dehumidifier mode, fan-only mode.It can dehumidify up to 46 pints or 22 liters a day.What makes this particularly suitable for RV use is its size-to-performance ratio. It's powerful enough to cool a typical RV main living area but compact enough to store when not in use – a crucial consideration in our limited spaces.It does take up a bit of space; however, everything in RV life is a choice and a sacrifice. And I am more than willing to sacrifice some space in order to keep my home at a comfortable temperature, even when it’s 97 degrees and super humid outside, or 88 degrees and you are parked in full sun.Unlike many portable ACs designed for residential use, the Dr. Prepare won't overwhelm your RV's electrical system when connected to shore power, if you don’t run other high energy appliances at the same time, like a coffee maker, ice maker, or microwave, and in some configurations, it can even be run from a robust solar/battery setup – something we'll discuss more later.The unit features a window exhaust kit for venting hot air, a drain hose for dehumidification mode, and simple controls that anyone can master. It's also relatively quiet compared to many competitors, which matters a lot in small RV spaces where you're never far from your appliances.I want to be fully transparent – in my small space, this does cool my entire RV. I use it more like dual zone cooling system. The portable unit for the main living area and kitchen and my mini-split for the back bedroom. I found that pushing cool air through the small hallway in between, even with a fan, just didn’t allow the entire RV to stay as cool as I like it in extreme heat conditions. In my experience, it can lower the temperature in my 20-foot RV by about 10-15 degrees in under an hour.Now let's talk about how to install and optimize this unit in your RV.Installing a Portable AC Unit in Your RVInstalling the Dr. Prepare in an RV requires some creativity, as our windows aren't exactly like residential windows that most portable ACs are designed for. Here's my step-by-step process:First, identify the best location. You want to place the unit where:It's close to a window for ventingIt won't block essential walkwaysIt can direct airflow to living areasIt's near a power outletI've found the best spot in my Class C RV is the sliding upper bunk window, but your layout may differ.Option 1:If you have a sliding RV window, you can often use the included kit with minor modifications. I simply did not use the window adapters. Instead, I created a simple adapter making a template of the exhaust hose hole fromheavy duty Reflectixand taped it together, then attached it to the window with duct tape. Because there’s a screen there, bugs can’t get in, and I can still shut the window if there’s a storm or on a travel day. I leave this attached all the time, so I can pack away or set up the portable AC unit and get that ac back on quickly when I get to a new destination.Option 2:For non-sliding or larger windows, it does come with 2 plastic extenders to attach the exhaust hose and seal off the rest of the window.Don’t forget that RVs move! You need to secure the unit for travel days. This unit does have wheels! On a travel day, I place the unit on the floor, between 2 other heavy items that I know won’t move, which prevents the ac unit from sliding around when we're on the road.I know that if I were going to be traveling through more mountainous territory, I would probably have to secure it a little better.For power, the Dr. Prepare draws about 780 watts. This means you'll want to connect it to a proper outlet in your RV – preferably one on a circuit without other major appliances. When boondocking, you'll need to carefully consider your power capabilities, which we'll discuss shortly.Once installed, test everything thoroughly. Check for air leaks around your window adapter, make sure the exhaust is venting properly, and confirm the drainage system is working if you're using the dehumidifier function.Tip:position the unit to maximize airflow throughout your RV. In my setup, I use a use a small fan to help circulate the cooled air to other areas of the RV, which dramatically improves efficiency.Power ConsiderationsLet's talk about one of the most important considerations for running any AC in an RV – power requirements.Here’s the controversial side. You may not agree with how I power this thing up, but, it works for me.When connected to shore power at a campground, the Dr. Prepare draws approximately 780 watts during operation. Most RV parks provide 30-amp service, which gives you about 3,600 watts to work with, or 50-amp service with even more capacity. This means the portable AC can run comfortably alongside most of your other appliances when connected to shore power.Because this portable AC unit takes quite a bit of juice, I don’t like running this through my 30 amp RV power, so I use a50 amp adaptorto run my RV, and a 30 amp adaptor that I run to the portable ac unit. Or you can use asplit 50 adaptorand plug into the 50 amp service only.This doesn’t mean that my 30 amp rv can magically run 50 amps worth of gadgets. Because I have found that some campgrounds offer only 30 and 50 amp plugs, and no 20 amp, but they all almost offer both 30 and 50 amp on the power pole, I set this up so I don’t have to switch it every time I get to a new campground.I have aheavy duty 20 amp extension cordto run the portable ac off of, connected to a surge protector that I plug only the ac into. A dedicated line, if you will.This also means that if the power at the park goes, I will loose the cooling effects of the portable ac unit, as it is not set up to run off my solar energy.However, if this should happen and the power goes out, I do have my minisplit that does run the ac off the solar set up, and would still be able to cool my RV into the mid 80’s all by itself, and still keep my dogs safe until I could get back.Mywifi thermostathas an alarm set up to notify me if the temperature in the RV goes above 75 so I could check from wherever I am and see what the situation is.What about when boondocking? You have two main options: generator power or solar/battery power.Theoretically, I could run the portable AC unit through the RV electric, but it would eat through my power fairly quickly, even on a sunny day.You could also run it off a generator. For generator use, you'll need at least a 2000-watt inverter generator to comfortably run the Dr. Prepare. I recommend theWen 3600-watt portable inverter generatorwhich provides enough power while remaining relatively quiet. Remember to account for generator startup surge when the compressor kicks on.For solar and battery power, this gets more complex. The Dr. Prepare draws about 780 watts continuously when running. To power it through a typical day of operation, you'd need:A robust battery bank(I recommend at least 300Ah of lithium capacity)A large solar array (minimum 600 watts, preferably more)A pure sine wave inverter rated for at least 2000 wattsLet's be realistic – running any air conditioner on solar is challenging. In my setup, I can run the Dr. Prepare for about 8 hours on my battery bank or one hour on my portable power banks, if they are fully charged. This works for taking the edge off during the hottest part of the day, but not for 24/7 cooling.My strategy is to use a combination approach: run the portable AC during the hottest hours when my solar production is highest, then close off my bedroom when I’m sleeping and just cool that area, using less electricity.To maximize runtime, use the unit's power-saving features like programmable timers, temperature-based auto-shutoff, and sleep mode.OptimizingPerformanceNow that we have the Dr. Prepare installed and powered, let's talk about getting the most cooling power from it.First, strategic positioning makes a huge difference. Cool air falls, so placing the unit slightly elevated helps with circulation. I have mine on a counter top about 3 feet off the floor.Second, manage your airflow. You can adjust the ac flow side to side and up and down, as needed. During the day I find myself getting cold, but I don’t want to shut the ac off and have the RV heat up quickly, so I will adjust the flow up.And then there are times when I come in after spending time out in the heat, where I want all of the cold air hitting me directly!Third, regular maintenance is super important. Clean the filters daily on the portable AC unit when in heavy use – otherwise weekly is fine. Clogged filters can reduce efficiency by up to 30%! Also check the exhaust hose and connections to ensure there are no air leaks.Fourth, consider zoning your RV. By closing doors or hanging thermal curtains to partition your space, you can focus the cooling power where you need it most. I often cool just the main living area during the day, then shift to cooling the bedroom area shortly before sleep.I find that when conserving power and trying to stay cool in the summer, or warm in the winter, this technique makes a huge difference.Fifth, monitor your temperatures. I use inexpensivedigital thermometersin different zones of my RV to track effectiveness. This helps me adjust my strategy based on real data rather than just how it feels. I’ll leave a link in the description for the digital, wifi capable thermometer that I use to monitor the temperature in my RV, especially when I have to go out and leave the dogs at home on a hot day.It’s also programmable, in the sense that if the temperature goes over a certain degree, I will get a notification on my cell phone so I can see what’s going on and determine if I need to get back home quickly or not.Finally, use the programmable features on the portable air conditioner unit intelligently. I set my unit to reach my target temperature in the morning before I need it, rather than waiting until the RV heats up. This saves significant power while still keeping the space comfortable when it matters most.My favorite thing about this air conditioner is that it is wifi capable, so not only can I check the temperature in the RV when I’m not home so that I know my dogs are comfortable, I can raise and lower the temperature or turn the blower speed up and down with the app on my phone, from wherever I am.Complimentary RV Cooling Strategies to Keep Your RV CoolThe Dr. Prepare portable AC works best as part of a comprehensive cooling strategy. Here are the complementary approaches I use to maximize cooling while minimizing power consumption:First,reflective window coveringsare absolutely essential. These reflective surfaces can reduce the heat entering through windows by up to 60%, which means your AC doesn't have to work as hard.Second, address your roof – the largest surface exposed to direct sun. Try to park under a tree if possible. This creates an air gap between the sun and your roof, dramatically reducing heat transfer.Third, use your awning strategically. Extending your awning on the sun-facing side of your RV creates shade not just for your outdoor space, but reduces heat transfer through those walls and windows too.Finally, reduce internal heat sources. LED lighting, cooking outdoors, and using the microwave instead of the stove can all significantly reduce the heat generated inside your RV.When combined with the Dr. Prepare portable AC, these strategies create a comprehensive cooling system that's far more effective than any single approach alone, including using just my mini split air conditioner on those days when the temperature outside is well over 90 degrees, and the humidity level is 87%. I can maintain a 73 degree temperature and a 67% humidity level using this combined method.Troubleshooting Common IssuesLet's address some common issues you might encounter with the Dr. Prepare and how to solve them:Problem 1:Water buildup. In high humidity environments, you may notice water collecting faster than it can evaporate. The solution is to connect the drain hose and direct it to an appropriate drain or collection container. I use a4.5 gallon collapsable bucket to manage this in my setup. And in the hotter, more humid months, I was emptying the bucket twice a day.I finally figured out a way to run the drain hose from the portable AC unit directly outside, without having to cut a hole in the outside of the RV, but it took a little creativity and a LOT of thinking.I highly recommend doing this, if you can. It will save you the headache of having to empty a heavy bucket every 4 to 6 hours.Problem 2:Power fluctuations. If your power source isn't stable, the unit may shut down unexpectedly. I recommend using a surge protector and, if possible, a small UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) to buffer minor fluctuations and protect your ac unit.Problem 3:Insufficient cooling. If your unit seems to be running but not cooling effectively, check the filters first – they're easy to clean and are often the culprit. Make sure nothing is blocking the vents, like curtains. Also verify that your exhaust hose hasn’t been knocked loose or come separated from the unit, is properly venting hot air outside and isn't kinked or restricted.Problem 4:Thermostat accuracy. I've found that the built-in thermostat sometimes needs calibration. I use a separate digital thermometer as reference and adjust my settings accordingly.Remember that no portable AC is magic – they all have limitations. If outside temperatures are extreme, expect that your portable unit will help but may not be able to cool your entire RV to a chilly 68°F. Be realistic about what's possible in your specific conditions.I have found I can keep my RV about 20 degrees cooler than the outside temperature, and the humidity about 15% lower. So if it’s 98 outside, my expectation is 78 inside. Still a little hotter than I like it, but much better that the 10 degree difference I was getting last year on super hot days. I was miserableIs the Dr. Prepare Portable AC unit a good cooling solution?There you have it – a complete strategy for staying cool in your RV using the Dr. Prepare portable air conditioner, along with complementary approaches that maximize its effectiveness.The key takeaways:Install your unit properly with a secure window adapterUnderstand and manage your power requirementsOptimize performance through positioning and maintenanceCombine with other cooling strategies for maximum effectKnow how to troubleshoot common issuesRV life doesn't have to mean suffering through heat waves or being tied to campgrounds with electrical hookups.

A dedicated line, if you will.This also means that if the power at the park goes, I will loose the cooling effects of the portable ac unit, as it is not set up to run off my solar energy.However, if this should happen and the power goes out, I do have my minisplit that does run the ac off the solar set up, and would still be able to cool my RV into the mid 80’s all by itself, and still keep my dogs safe until I could get back.Mywifi thermostathas an alarm set up to notify me if the temperature in the RV goes above 75 so I could check from wherever I am and see what the situation is.What about when boondocking? You have two main options: generator power or solar/battery power.Theoretically, I could run the portable AC unit through the RV electric, but it would eat through my power fairly quickly, even on a sunny day.You could also run it off a generator. For generator use, you'll need at least a 2000-watt inverter generator to comfortably run the Dr. Prepare. I recommend theWen 3600-watt portable inverter generatorwhich provides enough power while remaining relatively quiet. Remember to account for generator startup surge when the compressor kicks on.For solar and battery power, this gets more complex. The Dr. Prepare draws about 780 watts continuously when running. To power it through a typical day of operation, you'd need:A robust battery bank(I recommend at least 300Ah of lithium capacity)A large solar array (minimum 600 watts, preferably more)A pure sine wave inverter rated for at least 2000 wattsLet's be realistic – running any air conditioner on solar is challenging. In my setup, I can run the Dr. Prepare for about 8 hours on my battery bank or one hour on my portable power banks, if they are fully charged. This works for taking the edge off during the hottest part of the day, but not for 24/7 cooling.My strategy is to use a combination approach: run the portable AC during the hottest hours when my solar production is highest, then close off my bedroom when I’m sleeping and just cool that area, using less electricity.To maximize runtime, use the unit's power-saving features like programmable timers, temperature-based auto-shutoff, and sleep mode.OptimizingPerformanceNow that we have the Dr. Prepare installed and powered, let's talk about getting the most cooling power from it.First, strategic positioning makes a huge difference. Cool air falls, so placing the unit slightly elevated helps with circulation. I have mine on a counter top about 3 feet off the floor.Second, manage your airflow. You can adjust the ac flow side to side and up and down, as needed. During the day I find myself getting cold, but I don’t want to shut the ac off and have the RV heat up quickly, so I will adjust the flow up.And then there are times when I come in after spending time out in the heat, where I want all of the cold air hitting me directly!Third, regular maintenance is super important. Clean the filters daily on the portable AC unit when in heavy use – otherwise weekly is fine. Clogged filters can reduce efficiency by up to 30%! Also check the exhaust hose and connections to ensure there are no air leaks.Fourth, consider zoning your RV. By closing doors or hanging thermal curtains to partition your space, you can focus the cooling power where you need it most. I often cool just the main living area during the day, then shift to cooling the bedroom area shortly before sleep.I find that when conserving power and trying to stay cool in the summer, or warm in the winter, this technique makes a huge difference.Fifth, monitor your temperatures. I use inexpensivedigital thermometersin different zones of my RV to track effectiveness. This helps me adjust my strategy based on real data rather than just how it feels. I’ll leave a link in the description for the digital, wifi capable thermometer that I use to monitor the temperature in my RV, especially when I have to go out and leave the dogs at home on a hot day.It’s also programmable, in the sense that if the temperature goes over a certain degree, I will get a notification on my cell phone so I can see what’s going on and determine if I need to get back home quickly or not.Finally, use the programmable features on the portable air conditioner unit intelligently. I set my unit to reach my target temperature in the morning before I need it, rather than waiting until the RV heats up. This saves significant power while still keeping the space comfortable when it matters most.My favorite thing about this air conditioner is that it is wifi capable, so not only can I check the temperature in the RV when I’m not home so that I know my dogs are comfortable, I can raise and lower the temperature or turn the blower speed up and down with the app on my phone, from wherever I am.Complimentary RV Cooling Strategies to Keep Your RV CoolThe Dr. Prepare portable AC works best as part of a comprehensive cooling strategy. Here are the complementary approaches I use to maximize cooling while minimizing power consumption:First,reflective window coveringsare absolutely essential. These reflective surfaces can reduce the heat entering through windows by up to 60%, which means your AC doesn't have to work as hard.Second, address your roof – the largest surface exposed to direct sun. Try to park under a tree if possible. This creates an air gap between the sun and your roof, dramatically reducing heat transfer.Third, use your awning strategically. Extending your awning on the sun-facing side of your RV creates shade not just for your outdoor space, but reduces heat transfer through those walls and windows too.Finally, reduce internal heat sources. LED lighting, cooking outdoors, and using the microwave instead of the stove can all significantly reduce the heat generated inside your RV.When combined with the Dr. Prepare portable AC, these strategies create a comprehensive cooling system that's far more effective than any single approach alone, including using just my mini split air conditioner on those days when the temperature outside is well over 90 degrees, and the humidity level is 87%. I can maintain a 73 degree temperature and a 67% humidity level using this combined method.Troubleshooting Common IssuesLet's address some common issues you might encounter with the Dr. Prepare and how to solve them:Problem 1:Water buildup. In high humidity environments, you may notice water collecting faster than it can evaporate. The solution is to connect the drain hose and direct it to an appropriate drain or collection container. I use a4.5 gallon collapsable bucket to manage this in my setup. And in the hotter, more humid months, I was emptying the bucket twice a day.I finally figured out a way to run the drain hose from the portable AC unit directly outside, without having to cut a hole in the outside of the RV, but it took a little creativity and a LOT of thinking.I highly recommend doing this, if you can. It will save you the headache of having to empty a heavy bucket every 4 to 6 hours.Problem 2:Power fluctuations. If your power source isn't stable, the unit may shut down unexpectedly. I recommend using a surge protector and, if possible, a small UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) to buffer minor fluctuations and protect your ac unit.Problem 3:Insufficient cooling. If your unit seems to be running but not cooling effectively, check the filters first – they're easy to clean and are often the culprit. Make sure nothing is blocking the vents, like curtains. Also verify that your exhaust hose hasn’t been knocked loose or come separated from the unit, is properly venting hot air outside and isn't kinked or restricted.Problem 4:Thermostat accuracy. I've found that the built-in thermostat sometimes needs calibration. I use a separate digital thermometer as reference and adjust my settings accordingly.Remember that no portable AC is magic – they all have limitations. If outside temperatures are extreme, expect that your portable unit will help but may not be able to cool your entire RV to a chilly 68°F. Be realistic about what's possible in your specific conditions.I have found I can keep my RV about 20 degrees cooler than the outside temperature, and the humidity about 15% lower. So if it’s 98 outside, my expectation is 78 inside. Still a little hotter than I like it, but much better that the 10 degree difference I was getting last year on super hot days. I was miserableIs the Dr. Prepare Portable AC unit a good cooling solution?There you have it – a complete strategy for staying cool in your RV using the Dr. Prepare portable air conditioner, along with complementary approaches that maximize its effectiveness.The key takeaways:Install your unit properly with a secure window adapterUnderstand and manage your power requirementsOptimize performance through positioning and maintenanceCombine with other cooling strategies for maximum effectKnow how to troubleshoot common issuesRV life doesn't have to mean suffering through heat waves or being tied to campgrounds with electrical hookups.

      "When I was thinking about spending May, June, July and some of August in Florida this summer, I knew I had to find a solution to staying cool in my RV,For the past 2 years, I swore I would never be in Florida after Memorial Day, and even that’s pushing it with the heat. And I have headed north in search of cooler temps.But this year, I really wanted to stay in Florida and travel to some very hot Florida destinations that are more difficult to get into when it starts to cool off in the rest of the country.So, in January, after some research, I decided to purchase the Dr. Prepare portable AC unit and test it out.Before we talk solutions, let's understand the problem.RVs heat up much faster than traditional homes for several reasons:First, they have less insulation. Most RVs simply don't have the thick walls and insulation of standard houses. Even the best-built RVs typically have thinner walls with less space for insulative material.Second, they have proportionally more windows relative to their size. While windows are great for natural light and views, they're terrible for temperature regulation. They let in massive amounts of solar heat and offer minimal insulation.My double-paned windows help, but a Lazy Dazes RV has the biggest windows all around, to allow for amazing panoramic views, and let a lot of heat and cold in.",

      "Let's talk about one of the most important considerations for running any AC in an RV – power requirements.Here’s the controversial side. You may not agree with how I power this thing up, but, it works for me.When connected to shore power at a campground, the Dr. Prepare draws approximately 780 watts during operation. Most RV parks provide 30-amp service, which gives you about 3,600 watts to work with, or 50-amp service with even more capacity. This means the portable AC can run comfortably alongside most of your other appliances when connected to shore power.Because this portable AC unit takes quite a bit of juice, I don’t like running this through my 30 amp RV power, so I use a50 amp adaptorto run my RV, and a 30 amp adaptor that I run to the portable ac unit. Or you can use asplit 50 adaptorand plug into the 50 amp service only.This doesn’t mean that my 30 amp rv can magically run 50 amps worth of gadgets. Because I have found that some campgrounds offer only 30 and 50 amp plugs, and no 20 amp, but they all almost offer both 30 and 50 amp on the power pole, I set this up so I don’t have to switch it every time I get to a new campground.I have aheavy duty 20 amp extension cordto run the portable ac off of, connected to a surge protector that I plug only the ac into. A dedicated line, if you will.This also means that if the power at the park goes, I will loose the cooling effects of the portable ac unit, as it is not set up to run off my solar energy.However, if this should happen and the power goes out, I do have my minisplit that does run the ac off the solar set up, and would still be able to cool my RV into the mid 80’s all by itself, and still keep my dogs safe until I could get back.Mywifi thermostathas an alarm set up to notify me if the temperature in the RV goes above 75 so I could check from wherever I am and see what the situation is.What about when boondocking?

This works for taking the edge off during the hottest part of the day, but not for 24/7 cooling.My strategy is to use a combination approach: run the portable AC during the hottest hours when my solar production is highest, then close off my bedroom when I’m sleeping and just cool that area, using less electricity.To maximize runtime, use the unit's power-saving features like programmable timers, temperature-based auto-shutoff, and sleep mode.",

This means the portable AC can run comfortably alongside most of your other appliances when connected to shore power.",
      "Because this portable AC unit takes quite a bit of juice, I don’t like running this through my 30 amp RV power, so I use a50 amp adaptorto run my RV, and a 30 amp adaptor that I run to the portable ac unit. Or you can use asplit 50 adaptorand plug into the 50 amp service only.",
      "This doesn’t mean that my 30 amp rv can magically run 50 amps worth of gadgets. Because I have found that some campgrounds offer only 30 and 50 amp plugs, and no 20 amp, but they all almost offer both 30 and 50 amp on the power pole, I set this up so I don’t have to switch it every time I get to a new campground.",
      "I have aheavy duty 20 amp extension cordto run the portable ac off of, connected to a surge protector that I plug only the ac into. A dedicated line, if you will.",
      "heavy duty 20 amp extension cord",
      "This also means that if the power at the park goes, I will loose the cooling effects of the portable ac unit, as it is not set up to run off my solar energy.",
      "However, if this should happen and the power goes out, I do have my minisplit that does run the ac off the solar set up, and would still be able to cool my RV into the mid 80’s all by itself, and still keep my dogs safe until I could get back.",
      "Mywifi thermostathas an alarm set up to notify me if the temperature in the RV goes above 75 so I could check from wherever I am and see what the situation is.",
      "What about when boondocking? You have two main options: generator power or solar/battery power.",
      "Theoretically, I could run the portable AC unit through the RV electric, but it would eat through my power fairly quickly, even on a sunny day.",
      "You could also run it off a generator. For generator use, you'll need at least a 2000-watt inverter generator to comfortably run the Dr. Prepare. I recommend theWen 3600-watt portable inverter generatorwhich provides enough power while remaining relatively quiet. Remember to account for generator startup surge when the compressor kicks on.",
      "Wen 3600-watt portable inverter generator",
      "For solar and battery power, this gets more complex. The Dr. Prepare draws about 780 watts continuously when running. To power it through a typical day of operation, you'd need:",
      "A robust battery bank(I recommend at least 300Ah of lithium capacity)",
      "A large solar array (minimum 600 watts, preferably more)",
      "A pure sine wave inverter rated for at least 2000 watts",
      "Let's be realistic – running any air conditioner on solar is challenging. In my setup, I can run the Dr. Prepare for about 8 hours on my battery bank or one hour on my portable power banks, if they are fully charged. This works for taking the edge off during the hottest part of the day, but not for 24/7 cooling.",
      "My strategy is to use a combination approach: run the portable AC during the hottest hours when my solar production is highest, then close off my bedroom when I’m sleeping and just cool that area, using less electricity.",
      "To maximize runtime, use the unit's power-saving features like programmable timers, temperature-based auto-shutoff, and sleep mode.",
      "Now that we have the Dr. Prepare installed and powered, let's talk about getting the most cooling power from it.First, strategic positioning makes a huge difference. Cool air falls, so placing the unit slightly elevated helps with circulation. I have mine on a counter top about 3 feet off the floor.Second, manage your airflow. You can adjust the ac flow side to side and up and down, as needed. During the day I find myself getting cold, but I don’t want to shut the ac off and have the RV heat up quickly, so I will adjust the flow up.And then there are times when I come in after spending time out in the heat, where I want all of the cold air hitting me directly!Third, regular maintenance is super important. Clean the filters daily on the portable AC unit when in heavy use – otherwise weekly is fine. Clogged filters can reduce efficiency by up to 30%! Also check the exhaust hose and connections to ensure there are no air leaks.Fourth, consider zoning your RV. By closing doors or hanging thermal curtains to partition your space, you can focus the cooling power where you need it most. I often cool just the main living area during the day, then shift to cooling the bedroom area shortly before sleep.I find that when conserving power and trying to stay cool in the summer, or warm in the winter, this technique makes a huge difference.Fifth, monitor your temperatures. I use inexpensivedigital thermometersin different zones of my RV to track effectiveness. This helps me adjust my strategy based on real data rather than just how it feels. I’ll leave a link in the description for the digital, wifi capable thermometer that I use to monitor the temperature in my RV, especially when I have to go out and leave the dogs at home on a hot day.It’s also programmable, in the sense that if the temperature goes over a certain degree, I will get a notification on my cell phone so I can see what’s going on and determine if I need to get back home quickly or not.Finally, use the programmable features on the portable air conditioner unit intelligently. I set my unit to reach my target temperature in the morning before I need it, rather than waiting until the RV heats up. This saves significant power while still keeping the space comfortable when it matters most.",

      "Complimentary RV Cooling Strategies to Keep Your RV Cool",
      "The Dr. Prepare portable AC works best as part of a comprehensive cooling strategy. Here are the complementary approaches I use to maximize cooling while minimizing power consumption:First,reflective window coveringsare absolutely essential. These reflective surfaces can reduce the heat entering through windows by up to 60%, which means your AC doesn't have to work as hard.Second, address your roof – the largest surface exposed to direct sun. Try to park under a tree if possible. This creates an air gap between the sun and your roof, dramatically reducing heat transfer.",

      "Second, address your roof – the largest surface exposed to direct sun. Try to park under a tree if possible. This creates an air gap between the sun and your roof, dramatically reducing heat transfer.",
      "Third, use your awning strategically. Extending your awning on the sun-facing side of your RV creates shade not just for your outdoor space, but reduces heat transfer through those walls and windows too.Finally, reduce internal heat sources. LED lighting, cooking outdoors, and using the microwave instead of the stove can all significantly reduce the heat generated inside your RV.When combined with the Dr. Prepare portable AC, these strategies create a comprehensive cooling system that's far more effective than any single approach alone, including using just my mini split air conditioner on those days when the temperature outside is well over 90 degrees, and the humidity level is 87%. I can maintain a 73 degree temperature and a 67% humidity level using this combined method.",

      "Let's address some common issues you might encounter with the Dr. Prepare and how to solve them:Problem 1:Water buildup. In high humidity environments, you may notice water collecting faster than it can evaporate. The solution is to connect the drain hose and direct it to an appropriate drain or collection container. I use a4.5 gallon collapsable bucket to manage this in my setup. And in the hotter, more humid months, I was emptying the bucket twice a day.I finally figured out a way to run the drain hose from the portable AC unit directly outside, without having to cut a hole in the outside of the RV, but it took a little creativity and a LOT of thinking.I highly recommend doing this, if you can. It will save you the headache of having to empty a heavy bucket every 4 to 6 hours.Problem 2:Power fluctuations. If your power source isn't stable, the unit may shut down unexpectedly. I recommend using a surge protector and, if possible, a small UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) to buffer minor fluctuations and protect your ac unit.Problem 3:Insufficient cooling. If your unit seems to be running but not cooling effectively, check the filters first – they're easy to clean and are often the culprit. Make sure nothing is blocking the vents, like curtains. Also verify that your exhaust hose hasn’t been knocked loose or come separated from the unit, is properly venting hot air outside and isn't kinked or restricted.Problem 4:Thermostat accuracy. I've found that the built-in thermostat sometimes needs calibration. I use a separate digital thermometer as reference and adjust my settings accordingly.Remember that no portable AC is magic – they all have limitations. If outside temperatures are extreme, expect that your portable unit will help but may not be able to cool your entire RV to a chilly 68°F. Be realistic about what's possible in your specific conditions.I have found I can keep my RV about 20 degrees cooler than the outside temperature, and the humidity about 15% lower. So if it’s 98 outside, my expectation is 78 inside. Still a little hotter than I like it, but much better that the 10 degree difference I was getting last year on super hot days. I was miserable",

      "Skip to contentMaking My Own LaneHomeYou TubeRV Budget WorksheetThousand TrailsGift IdeasRV Living ResourcesBlogWork With MeContact meContact meExploring Voyageurs National Park: A Journey Through Minnesota's WildernessWritten by Nancy Carter of Making My Own LaneThis article contains affiliate links. We will make a commission when you make a purchase at no cost to you, but it helps keep me on the road! Thanks for your support.Voyageurs National ParkEstablished as a National Park in 1975, Voyageurs National Park is named after the French Canadian voyageurs who hunted, fished, trapped and traded furs from these waters and lands.This beautiful area in northern Minnesota covers218,000 Acres of remote Lakes forests and islands.Water makes up more than one-third of the park, and the best way to explore the park is by boat.What is the closest city to Voyageurs National Park?The closest city is International Falls, Minnesota, the coldest town in the nation, with a population of about 5,800, where you can visit the Smoky the Bear monument or shop for essentials or touristy items.I’ve been told that International Falls is the closest experience you can get for Alaska, without leaving the Continental United States.It’s about 2 miles from the Rainy Visitor Center, the westernmost of the three Visitor Centers in Voyageurs.With about 240,000 people that visit Voyageurs National Park each year, it is one of the least visited National Parks, which was perfectly fine with me. I found it to be a place of peace and solitude, where I could sit by the lake and read a book or stare up at the stars for hours.Check out my summer reading list here, and bookmark it for to see books I add to the list as I read them!Where did I stay in Voyageurs National Park?I chose The Pines of Kabetogama as my base camp for my stay because of its central location to all three rangerstations and its amenities.Many of the other camps in this area are very remote and/or first come, first served; however, there are a few other “resort fishing camps” around.I did check out theWooden Frog Campgroundwhile I was there. It was primitive, providing only the basic needs for a camper. The reviews I read said the sites were “spacious”; however, I can’t imagine getting anything larger than a van down those roads or into those sites.For tent camping, it would be great, as long as you’re OK with vault toilets, no electricity, and no running water.But, the beauty of Voyageursisits remoteness and the opportunity to reconnect with nature.I wanted the luxury of hot showers, laundry, boat rentals, and the promise of a text if there were Northern Lights, which sadly did not happen during my stay there. (I missed them here by one night).At the Pines of Kabetogama, there were two “levels” to camp on. The lower level, where I was. Closer to the lodge and the water.Or you could choose the “upper” level, high upon a flat cliff. The views were spectacular, and there was plenty of room for larger rigs. But, you had to get up the cliff on a rocky dirt road with a pretty sharp turn. And then get back down.There are also really nice cabins, if you don’t have an RV.The waters were a little rough most days so I stuck with the Ranger Boats and tours. But,somany people brought their own boats.Voyagers is a dark sky park, meaning at night lights are supposed to be off so it's very dark to allow you to enjoy the beauty of the stars and skies.Even though this is a very remote area of the US, there were plenty of local stores to buy essentials you might have forgotten.What is there to do in Voyageurs National Park?Visit the Three Visitor Centers.My first stop was Rainy Lake Visitors Center, about 30 minutes away from my Campground and 20 minutes awayfrom International Falls. Yes, 2 miles, or 20 minutes away.While I did not get to see the elusive moose on this trip, there was one in the visitor center.Is there an entrance fee for Voyageurs National Park?This is one of those rare National Parks that does not require an entrance fee.There are over 150 remote campsites that you can reserve on the islands that are only accessible only by boats or by kayak.The best way to experience Voyagers is by boat. You can rent private boats with or without guides or you can bring your own boat.Another way to enjoy Voyagers is to rent a houseboat andexplore all four of the park's major lakes - Rainy, Kabatogama, Namakin and Sand Point.The next day I visited the Ash River Visitor Center, in the historic, Meadwood Lodge, which is where my boat tour to Kettle Falls was leaving from.The Lodge was built like a log cabin, and was well worth taking your time to explore its many nooks and crannies filled with history of the area.Ash River was about 20 minutes east of my campground.Are pets allowed on the trails?Pets were not allowed on many of the trails here, but there were plenty of trails at my campground to walk my dogs.While I was here I saw deer, bald eagles, beaver dams (no beaver) and even a turtle crossing the road, but no moose.On day three, I explored more of the area and some of the trails near the Ash River Visitors Center and I visited the Kabetogama Lake Visitor Center. It is the largest Visitor Center, less than 10 minutes from my campsite.The water in September was crystal clear and cold. Not really good for paddleboarding, although I did consider it, until I put my feet in the water.Kettle Falls Boat Tour.Day four was my highly anticipated boat tour. Boat tours run from all three Visitor Centers. I recommend booking your tours in advance if possible because they do fill up quickly.I was lucky to get the tour I wanted. The Kettle Falls Tour. On this tour, you get to follow some of the same route that the original voyageurs would have canoed through Rainy and Namakan Lakes. How cool is that?Because these tours were all ranger-led, you can save 50% off each tour if you have theAmerica the Beautiful Senior Pass.When you turn 62, you can buy this pass for just $80, and it is good for the rest of your lifeprovides access to hundreds of recreation sites managed by these six federal agencies:National Park ServiceUS Fish & Wildlife ServiceBureau of Land ManagementBureau of ReclamationUS Forest ServiceUS Army Corps of Engineersand discounts on ranger-led tours and camping!Learn more about the National Park Service senior passhere. You can buy the pass online, or avoid the extra \"fee\" and pick one up at any National Park Service office in a National Park.The Kettle Falls boat tour first stopped at the IW Stevens Resort, a beautiful, once year-round residence and now one of 13 visitor destination sites in Voyagers National Park.The smell of the jack pine forest is so amazing. Like a pine forest on the ocean, but the ocean is actually a lake.There is ongoing restoration throughout the park to ensure that we can learn about the people who chose to live a life of solitude and live off the land in this remote location.Our next stop was The Kettle Falls hotel, where I enjoyed a delicious lunch of freshly-caught walleye.The Kettle Falls Hotel was built in 1913. It's the only lodging within Voyagers National Park. There are three villa-type rooms that can house up to four people each.Kettle Falls is only accessible by boat or float plane. In the winter, you can also get there by snowmobile.For a unique experience, be sure to check out the bar at the hotel, nicknamed the Tiltin Hilton because of its sloping floors.On the way back to the Visitor Center, we passed an old logging camp, which is now used for a free teacher workshop for teachers to learn more about this unique area and bring the park back to the classroom so that students can learn and understand the importance of preserving national parks today.Here’s the link, if you'd like to know more about theVoyagers Conservancy Teacher Program.Where can I stay at Voyageurs National Park?The Kettle Falls Hotel, that I mentioned earlier, is the only \"hotel\" in Voyageurs National Park.There are some private campgrounds, including the Pines of Kabetogama, where I stayed, and some fishing camps.And some remote campgrounds, like the Wooden Frog Campground, or you can camp on an island within the park.I met a very adventurous woman that had reserved one of these islands to camp on, by herself (no dogs are allowed on the islands).She worked with a local kayak outfitter, and headed out to her island, only to realize that the current was stronger than she anticipated.She did eventually make it to her island paradise, but used a boat pick-up service through her outfitter to get back to the mainland.For a very unique experience, you can even rent a houseboat!Plan your next road trip! Get RV-friendly GPS, share your trip with friends and family.Was Voyageurs National Park worth visiting?Absolutely. It was one of the highlights of my trip. To see that such untouched, pristine areas still exist, and to learn how others lived in this sometimes harsh environment made me feel very connected to others who just prefer to be alone with their own company.If you have any comments, suggestions or questions about Voyageurs National Park, or if you would like to know when I publish a new article,you can message me here.Thanks for joining me on my journey of full-time RV life.Subscribe below for updatesas we travel and continue to enjoy and learn more about life on the road.Your privacy is important to us, and we do not share your information.

Yes, 2 miles, or 20 minutes away.While I did not get to see the elusive moose on this trip, there was one in the visitor center.Is there an entrance fee for Voyageurs National Park?This is one of those rare National Parks that does not require an entrance fee.There are over 150 remote campsites that you can reserve on the islands that are only accessible only by boats or by kayak.The best way to experience Voyagers is by boat. You can rent private boats with or without guides or you can bring your own boat.Another way to enjoy Voyagers is to rent a houseboat andexplore all four of the park's major lakes - Rainy, Kabatogama, Namakin and Sand Point.The next day I visited the Ash River Visitor Center, in the historic, Meadwood Lodge, which is where my boat tour to Kettle Falls was leaving from.The Lodge was built like a log cabin, and was well worth taking your time to explore its many nooks and crannies filled with history of the area.Ash River was about 20 minutes east of my campground.Are pets allowed on the trails?Pets were not allowed on many of the trails here, but there were plenty of trails at my campground to walk my dogs.While I was here I saw deer, bald eagles, beaver dams (no beaver) and even a turtle crossing the road, but no moose.On day three, I explored more of the area and some of the trails near the Ash River Visitors Center and I visited the Kabetogama Lake Visitor Center. It is the largest Visitor Center, less than 10 minutes from my campsite.The water in September was crystal clear and cold. Not really good for paddleboarding, although I did consider it, until I put my feet in the water.Kettle Falls Boat Tour.Day four was my highly anticipated boat tour. Boat tours run from all three Visitor Centers. I recommend booking your tours in advance if possible because they do fill up quickly.I was lucky to get the tour I wanted. The Kettle Falls Tour. On this tour, you get to follow some of the same route that the original voyageurs would have canoed through Rainy and Namakan Lakes. How cool is that?Because these tours were all ranger-led, you can save 50% off each tour if you have theAmerica the Beautiful Senior Pass.When you turn 62, you can buy this pass for just $80, and it is good for the rest of your lifeprovides access to hundreds of recreation sites managed by these six federal agencies:National Park ServiceUS Fish & Wildlife ServiceBureau of Land ManagementBureau of ReclamationUS Forest ServiceUS Army Corps of Engineersand discounts on ranger-led tours and camping!Learn more about the National Park Service senior passhere. You can buy the pass online, or avoid the extra \"fee\" and pick one up at any National Park Service office in a National Park.The Kettle Falls boat tour first stopped at the IW Stevens Resort, a beautiful, once year-round residence and now one of 13 visitor destination sites in Voyagers National Park.The smell of the jack pine forest is so amazing. Like a pine forest on the ocean, but the ocean is actually a lake.There is ongoing restoration throughout the park to ensure that we can learn about the people who chose to live a life of solitude and live off the land in this remote location.Our next stop was The Kettle Falls hotel, where I enjoyed a delicious lunch of freshly-caught walleye.The Kettle Falls Hotel was built in 1913. It's the only lodging within Voyagers National Park. There are three villa-type rooms that can house up to four people each.Kettle Falls is only accessible by boat or float plane. In the winter, you can also get there by snowmobile.For a unique experience, be sure to check out the bar at the hotel, nicknamed the Tiltin Hilton because of its sloping floors.On the way back to the Visitor Center, we passed an old logging camp, which is now used for a free teacher workshop for teachers to learn more about this unique area and bring the park back to the classroom so that students can learn and understand the importance of preserving national parks today.Here’s the link, if you'd like to know more about theVoyagers Conservancy Teacher Program.Where can I stay at Voyageurs National Park?The Kettle Falls Hotel, that I mentioned earlier, is the only \"hotel\" in Voyageurs National Park.There are some private campgrounds, including the Pines of Kabetogama, where I stayed, and some fishing camps.And some remote campgrounds, like the Wooden Frog Campground, or you can camp on an island within the park.I met a very adventurous woman that had reserved one of these islands to camp on, by herself (no dogs are allowed on the islands).She worked with a local kayak outfitter, and headed out to her island, only to realize that the current was stronger than she anticipated.She did eventually make it to her island paradise, but used a boat pick-up service through her outfitter to get back to the mainland.For a very unique experience, you can even rent a houseboat!Plan your next road trip! Get RV-friendly GPS, share your trip with friends and family.Was Voyageurs National Park worth visiting?Absolutely. It was one of the highlights of my trip. To see that such untouched, pristine areas still exist, and to learn how others lived in this sometimes harsh environment made me feel very connected to others who just prefer to be alone with their own company.If you have any comments, suggestions or questions about Voyageurs National Park, or if you would like to know when I publish a new article,you can message me here.Thanks for joining me on my journey of full-time RV life.Subscribe below for updatesas we travel and continue to enjoy and learn more about life on the road.Your privacy is important to us, and we do not share your information.

      "I’ve been told that International Falls is the closest experience you can get for Alaska, without leaving the Continental United States.",
      "It’s about 2 miles from the Rainy Visitor Center, the westernmost of the three Visitor Centers in Voyageurs.",
      "With about 240,000 people that visit Voyageurs National Park each year, it is one of the least visited National Parks, which was perfectly fine with me. I found it to be a place of peace and solitude, where I could sit by the lake and read a book or stare up at the stars for hours.Check out my summer reading list here, and bookmark it for to see books I add to the list as I read them!",

The reviews I read said the sites were “spacious”; however, I can’t imagine getting anything larger than a van down those roads or into those sites.For tent camping, it would be great, as long as you’re OK with vault toilets, no electricity, and no running water.",
