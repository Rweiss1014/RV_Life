It's the perfect opportunity to re-evaluate your priorities and focus on what truly adds value. But what if you live in a larger space? Can you still learn to live with less? It starts with a ruthless decluttering process. Everything that doesn't serve a purpose or bring joy has to go. It's not about depriving yourself of things you love, but about creating an environment that sparks joy and simplicity.But, it’s a daily struggle. Being emotionally attached to things, dealing with people who want to give you their stuff, and the constant pressure to buy more stuff. Consumerism that is handed to us every day in the form of commercials on our computers, our phones, and our TVs that give you that FOMO, or fear of missing out, feeling - missing out on what others have that you don’t.I chose not to buy a lot of things, not because I can’t afford them, but because I want to live a more simple life, where I am not controlled by having so much stuff to take care of.  The more you have, the more you have to maintain and keep up. I can afford more, I choose not to spend more.This blog post is not designed to offend anyone, or anyone’s current lifestyle or the decision to liv"

Please see our full disclosurefor more information.Can we make it from Pennsylvania to Florida on a 6-day, 1,100 mile trip while battling a coolant leak and solar power struggles?What else could possibly go wrong?Thanks for joining me on the final leg of my big journey from Florida to Minnesota and back.Day One - Pennsylvania to Delaware.It’s the first time in over three weeks that I have not had people available to me. I mean, I'm staying at a Harvest Host tonight. There's people, but not people I know.I'd been staying at my sister's house, and werea lot of people around, family and friends, for those 3 weeks,which took me a minute to get used to, after being alone on the road for five months. But day one of this trip I was really missing my family.Sunday was a short hour and a half drive. I stayed at a farm in theHarvest Hostnetwork in Newark, Delaware. Most Harvest Hosts do not provide electricity, so I was hoping I have some sunshine on Monday for solar to charge my batteries.By 3:30 I was starting to eat into my battery power. The temperatures got down into the low 40s, so I did need the heat on. I went to bed early to stay warm under layers of quilts, and shut the door from the back of the RV to the front so I was only heating the bedroom area.I’ve also been using thermal curtains between the cab and the living area, as well as putting one up over the door at night to stop any drafts. This has been working so well to help keep the warm in and the cold out.I unplugged as much as possible, including the microwave and the TV, and I ran my refrigerator on propane to help conserve my battery power.The other thing I did was to us"

Starting out with tents, and moving into a pop-up camper when my daughters were younger.We had so many happy trips in the pop up.  Exploring Florida State Parks and camping at Disney Fort Wilderness for holidays and special occasions.Once my daughters moved out on their own, I bought a tent again, a couple of cots, and went camping maybe once a year.  It got harder to find time to get away, as my job got more demanding and the girls’ social schedules got busier.But it was always a dream to travel and explore more.Create an RV Wish List of Must Have Options.In December of 2022, I created my wish list of what I would want in an RV.  I had no desire to buy one, but one can dream, right?I had been watching a lot of YouTube videos about different types of rigs.  Originally I thought I would want a Class B, or van type of rig.  Then I thought maybe a small Class A would be better.  Until I finally settled on a Class C.  You know, the one that has that overhang over the cab.Here is my list.  I wrote it on December 1, 2022.

At the same time, the boat tour is not run by the National Parks Service - therefore, you can’t use your national park pass for a discount.Where is Pictured Rocks?It is located between Munising and Grand Marais. When I visited, I stayed at the Munising KOA, about a 30 minute drive to the park and boat tour.What is the best way to see Pictured Rocks?The best way to see 20 miles of the 42-mile shoreline is by boat, and I decided on a 2-hour boat ride. Because this is a larger boat, it is more likely to run even when it’s windy with small craft advisories and other options may be cancelled.The guides will point out many of the different formations and points of interest and talk about the history of the park and the ever changing landscape. I chose the Spray Falls Cruise.Get there about 45 minutes before the boat leaves so you can get a seat on the left-side of the boat for the best views of the shoreline. But you will see everything from the right-hand side of the boat on the way back, without as much narration.I booked my boat tour about a month in advance. There were some people at the campground that were not able to book a cruise during their stay once they arrived at the park, so you may want to consider booking early to guarantee you"

Thanks for your support.Voyageurs National ParkEstablished as a National Park in 1975, Voyageurs National Park is named after the French Canadian voyageurs who hunted, fished, trapped and traded furs from these waters and lands.This beautiful area in northern Minnesota covers218,000 Acres of remote Lakes forests and islands.Water makes up more than one-third of the park, and the best way to explore the park is by boat.What is the closest city to Voyageurs National Park?The closest city is International Falls, Minnesota, the coldest town in the nation, with a population of about 5,800, where you can visit the Smoky the Bear monument or shop for essentials or touristy items.I’ve been told that International Falls is the closest experience you can get for Alaska, without leaving the Continental United States.It’s about 2 miles from the Rainy Visitor Center, the westernmost of the three Visitor Centers in Voyageurs.With about 240,000 people that visit Voyageurs National Park each year, it is one of the least visited National Parks, which was perfectly fine with me. I found it to be a place of peace and solitude, where I could sit by the lake and read a book or stare up at the stars for hours.Check out my summer reading list here, and bookmark it for to see books I add to the list as I read them!Where did I stay in Voyageurs National Park?I chose The Pines of Kabetogama as my base camp for my stay because of its central location to all three rangerstations and its amenities.Many of the other camps in this area are very remote and/or first come, first served; however, there are a few other “resort fishing camps” "

The closest US Interstate Highway is about 5 hours away. There are less than 100 year-round residents.There are only two roads into and out of Copper Harbor.US Highway 41 - an eleven-mile two-lane roadway winding through a tunnel of trees.

The snowfall average is 270 inches.The Astor Shipwreck of 1844I was drawn to a beautiful area along Lake Superior, about a 5-minute drive from the campground. As you look into the distance, you can see a lighthouse, the Copper Harbor Lighthouse.The only way to visit this lighthouse is by a guided boat tour.If you read the signage at the lakefront, you realize that you are looking at the exact site of the wreck of the schooner-style ship, the John Jacob Astor in 1844.No lives were lost, but the schooner was left in the small harbor until it just broke apart with the wreckage scattered between the Fort Wilkins dock and the Copper Harbor lighthouse.How many days do you need in Copper Harbor?I was there for two nights. You can also book a boat to Isle Royale National Park and leave your car or RV in Copper Harbor across from the dock.I was there in late August, and the boat tours were already running less frequently.Hint: book your boat tours well in advance to make sure you can get one, and check direc"

They gave it a fair shot and they decided it wasn't for them.Maybe it was too hard, too lonely or just too much work. but at least they tried. They're not going to look back on their life and 20 years and say I wish I'd done that, or what would have happened if I'd done that.I am going into my third year of RV life, and I would be lying to you if I told you I never thought about stopping - justread some of my other postsorwatch some of my YouTube videosto see some of the challenges that I have faced.Then there are other posts and videos that show you how amazing this life is. The “wow” moments, when you just sit and look out over a beautiful sunset, or a river, or a lake, and you just think “wow”.When you experience breathtakingly beautiful spots or when you meet new people that turn into friends or when you figure out a solution to something that you never even knew could be a problem until you started RV living, but you figure it out.And your confidence grows.I like to share the good and the bad and the average days. After all, I am not on vacation. This is my life. Complete with laundry grocery shopping, paying bills, babysitting for my granddaughter and dental appointments.So let's dive in.First, do you like to travel?I know that seems like a given, but do youreallylike to travel?

Even state park campgrounds on the east coast run about $50+ a night, and many other campgrounds are closer to $100 a night.Using $50 a night as a low average, the cost to live in my RV for a month would be at least $1,500 a month. Not including the cost of diesel, tolls, and repairs.  Maybe this full-time RV life wasn’t going to be such a great idea.In myStarting My Full-Time Adventure blog post, I left one thing out.  How would I be able to afford to pay for a place to sleep every night?I had heard about Thousand Trails, looked into it, and decided to buy a Southeast Zone pass (currently $755 for one year) with the Trails Collection option (+$450).  This gave me over 20 campgrounds in the Southeast that I could camp “for free”, or just the cost of the yearly dues.  Adding the Trails Collection added over 100 campgrounds, all over the country.  Total cost for the year is $1,205.You can add additional zones around the US for $125 per zone.The Zone passdoeshave limitations, and it gets confusing very quickly. Basically, you can stay for 14 days in a park, then you have to leave the system for 7 days.You can make your reservations up to 60 days in advance, which sometimes makes it challenging to get into the park you want.So, with the Thousand Trails Zone Pass and Trails Collective, I had a place to stay for up to 3 weeks a month.  But what about the 4th week? It was still going to cost me over $350, and a lot of headaches trying to find other campsites.Itcanbe confusing, but if you k"

Thanks for your support.Today I want to get real with you all about how living in this RV for the past two years has fundamentally changed who I am as a person.If you're new here, about two years ago, I decided to sell most of my possessions, buy this RV, and hit the road. At the time, I thought it would be a fun adventure, maybe something I'd do for a few years before returning to \"normal\" life. Little did I know that this lifestyle would completely transform my perspective on what \"normal\" even means.Today, I'm going to share the biggest ways RV life has changed me - from my relationship with material possessions to how I view community, from my daily habits to my long-term goals. So grab a cup of coffee, get comfortable, and let's dive in!Hey friends, welcome back to my blog! If you’re new here, I’m Nancy, and I’ve been living full-time in my RV for the pasttwo yearsnow. Two years of adventure, campgrounds, unexpected breakdowns, breathtaking sunsets—and a whole lot of personal growth.Materialism, Possessions and DownsizingThe first and perhaps most obvious way RV life has changed me is my relationship with stuff. When you live in under 200 square feet, every item you own needs to earn its place.Before I moved into the RV, I had a three-bedroom home filled with furniture, decorations, kitchen gadgets, clothes I rarely wore - you name it. I was constantly buying things I thought would make me happy or impress others. Shopping was literally a hobby.The process of downsizing was really painful at first. I remember sitting surrounded by all my belongings, trying to decide what was essential enough to bring into my new, tiny s"

You can certainly hike the park and see the three main waterfalls in one day.Day 1 - I entered the park at the Mt. Morris, the northernmost entrance. After checking in at Highbanks camping area, I found my campsite, took the dogs for a walk, set up, and then set off in my car to drive the park from one end to the other.There are a lot of stop-off sites with amazing scenic views of the gorge. My favorite one was at Big Bend, where I felt I could see the entire park. It was breathtaking.Letchwork State Park Big Bend OverlookThe day was overcast and misty, creating beautiful, low clouds in the gorge.I also stopped at the Visitor Center for a map and advice.

Boy, was I wrong! After spending several days exploring this incredible place while camping in my 27-foot motorhome, I can tell you that Mammoth Cave completely exceeded my expectations and became one of my favorite stops in all my RV travels.Here's the thing that blew my mind: this place isn't just about caves (though they're absolutely incredible). Mammoth Cave surprised me in more ways than one.It's where I witnessed the most spectacular Northern Lights display of my entire life – and I'm talking about Kentucky, not Minnesota or Alaska! Plus, there's this whole fascinating history of \"Cave Wars\" that reads like something out of a movie.Located in south-central Kentucky, Mammoth Cave protects what's officially the world's longest cave system. We're talking over 400 miles of surveyed passages, with another 600 miles they think are still out there waiting to be discovered. Whether you're like me and love a good adventure, or you're more of a history buff, this UNESCO World Heritage Site has something that'll make you go \"wow.\"Facts About the World's Longest Cave SystemIt's Absolutely Massive (And Still Growing!)Here's what stopped me in my tracks: Mammoth Cave is the world's longest cave system with over 400 miles of mapped passages. Researchers think there might be another 600 miles down there that haven't even been explored yet! That means every time you hear about Mammoth Cave, it could literally be ge"

The crowds were so much smaller than the October-to-April madness. I could actually find campground spots without booking six months ahead, and the locals had time to chat instead of being overwhelmed by tourists.The reality check: Between 1 PM and 7 PM, you're basically trapped in air conditioning.

I've been enjoying a glass of Kentucky's finest for years, appreciating the smooth warmth and complex flavors. But let me tell you – tasting bourbon and understanding bourbon are two completely different things.My recent four-day exploration of Kentucky's Bourbon Trail transformed me from a casual bourbon drinker into someone who truly appreciates the artistry, science, and heritage behind every bottle. I visited four distilleries, each offering a unique perspective on bourbon production.Where I Stayed For Bourbon Trail ExplorationBefore diving into the bourbon trail, let me share how I approached this adventure from an RV perspective. I split my Kentucky stay between two strategic base camps, each chosen to maximize my access to different clusters of distilleries while minimizing drive time and stress.My first stop was the Thousand Trails Diamond Caverns campground near Cave City. Staying here is free with my Thousand Trails membership, and I enjoyed comfortable camping with full hookups. This location gave me easy access to several distilleries in the southern part of the bourbon trail region, as well as Mammoth Cave National Park.Later, I moved north toKentucky Horse Park State Park Campgroundnear Lexington, paying $45 per night with my AAA discount. This put me right in the heart of bourbon country, surrounded by rolling hills, pristine horse farms, and multiple distilleries within a 30-minute drive. The campground itself was excellent – two double horseshoe-shaped loops, a well-stocked camp store with local products, and even tennis courts. It was the p"

LikeWatkins Glen, I could have stayed all day at the falls just taking in the beauty and the majesty of the water and the rock formations.Niagara Falls State Park was designed by Frederick Law Olmstead, the father of landscape architecture, who also designed the Biltmore Estate Gardens in Asheville, NC, and Central Park, NY.This park is about 400 acres of rapids, waterfalls, islands, 15 miles of hiking trails, and the Niagara Gorge. About 140 of the 400 acres is under water.How long does it take to walk through Niagara Falls State Park?I got there early on a Sunday morning, and there were rainbows everywhere, and the crowds were already starting to form.I spent about three hours walking the falls and through the park.It is a lot of walking, so be sure to wear comfortable, non-slips shoes. There are many areas where the ground is wet from the waterfall spray and mist.I did not see a place to stop and get a map, nor was I offered one at the ranger station/parking area.However, there were large signs with maps, and I took a picture on my phone so I knew where I was and where I wanted to go.A couple of times I did get a little lost. The first time I found myself exactly where I was looking to go, even though I thought I had to walk further.The second time I got lost was on my way back to my car, and I had to walk a little farther than I originally had thought.Luckily, I had a bottle of water, and an Uncrustables, my go-to hiking snack, with me to save me.Are pets allowed on the trails?Pets are allowed on the greenspace and footpaths, but they need to be kept on a leash no longer than six feet long.I did not bring my dogs"

That greenhouse effect is real! These metal and fiberglass boxes we call home can heat up FAST, turning your cozy space into an unbearable sauna in no time.But here's the good news – after three summers of full-time RV living in arguably the hottest and most humid region in the country, Florida, I've figured out a comprehensive cooling strategy that works. And the game-changer in my setup? My Dr. Prepare 10,000 BTU portable air conditioner with WIFI.I'm going to share everything I've learned about staying cool in an RV, with a special focus on how to maximize the efficiency of a portable AC unit that's been absolutely essential for my comfort. We'll cover installation, optimization, maintenance, and combine it with other heat-beating strategies to create a comprehensive cooling system for your RV.Understanding RV Cooling ChallengesWhen I was thinking about spending May, June, July and some of August in Florida this summer, I knew I had to find a solution to staying cool in my RV,For the past 2 years, I swore I would never be in Florida after Memorial Day, and even that’s pushing it with the heat. And I have headed north in search of cooler temps.But this year, I really wanted to stay in Florida and travel to some very hot Florida destinations that are more difficult to get into when it starts to cool off in the rest of the country.So, in Janua"

We will make a commission when you make a purchase at no cost to you, but it helps to keep me on the road. Thanks for your support!How and Why I Chose a Full-Time RV LifeLife is short, wouldn’t you agree? The lessons I learned during the craziness of 2020 and 2021 planted the seeds for change, and the events of 2022 pushed me over the edge.Taking time to reevaluate my job and lifestyle led me to understand that the opportunity I never believed was an option - slowing down, spending more time with family and friends, and traveling the US, really was a possibility.But in order to have this lifestyle, three things had to be in place.One. I needed an RV.I bought Daisy (my new-to-me 26.5 foot Class C motorhome) in December of 2022. Not to live in, but to travel locally with friends, and maybe to see the country when I could retire. Click here to read how I found Daisy, and why she is perfect for me.You can read more about how I chose Daisy here.Two. Paying for my lifestyle.Giving up the income I relied on to pay my mortgage and all the expenses that come with home ownership was not an option.But I hadn’t been happy for a long time, but I felt locked in. My life consisted of going to work so I could pay on a house that had grown too big, too empty, and full of stuff I no longer needed.So one day I quit my job.  Not necessarily what I expected to do when I woke up that morning, but certainly overdue.Three. Downsizing.Lots of soul-searching and finance-assessing showed me that living life in a motorhome and traveling more was a possibility,ifI sold my house, and everything in it.Not so sure about that idea, I did begin to purge my house of 20 years of stuff. Just in case, right? Three months later, I didn’t feel any cl"

Please see our full disclosurefor more information.Watkins Glen is a state park in the New York Finger Lakes region located in Watkins Glen, NY, about one and a half hours south of Rochester.The park itself is less than two square miles, but don’t let that fool you.The 19 waterfalls and 400-foot deep gorge are spectacular.And yes, this can be a challenging hike, with many steps to get up into the falls area.However, there is an easier way, and a harder way. Let me share with you the easier way, some of the amazing sights you will experience along your path, and a few tips that will make your day much more enjoyable.How long does it take to hike Watkins Glen?You can hike the main Gorge Trail, where you will see all 19 of the waterfalls and sights in less than two hours. Even if you stop to take lots of pictures, like I did.It’s 1.5 miles long.I recommend getting there in the morning, no later than 10 am or so. This will help you to beat the crowds, and avoid the hottest part of the day.I did this hike in July, and it was hot, but the waterfalls and tree cover along the way help to keep you a little cooler.Bring the proper gear for your hikeYou don’t need a lot, but I would recommend a few things to make your hike more enjoyable.1. Proper hiking shoes. The trails will be wet in spots, and rocky. So it is important to wear shoes with non-slip soles that you will be comfortable in if your feet get wet.My favorite hiking shoe is a hiking sandal. They are the most comfortable hiking shoes I have ever worn. Non-slip, my feet can breathe and expand (as my feet often do as the day goes on), a"

At the same time, it does fall under the National Park Pass that I will talk more about a little later.Also, if you download theNPS app, you can find guided audio tours and the history of the park, and all the parks that fall under “National Park” status, even if they aren’t officially National Parks.For some reason, I only allowed myself 24 hours at Sleeping Bear Dunes.Actually more like 18 hours, after I checked in and got my bearings.I checked into the campground, set up my site, and headed out to explore around 6 pm.When visiting the dunes in the summer, it will stay light out until almost 9:30 pm, so I had 3 hours to hike.The park ranger had recommended that I head north from Platte River Campground, a National Lakeshore Campground, toPierce Stocking Scenic DriveThe drive is a 7.4 mile loop with 12 numbered points of interest.Hint - Download the NPS app and pull up Sleeping Bear Dunes for a guided, narrated tour as you get to each stop.At the Number 9 stop of the Scenic Drive, you will find the 284-foot, 45 degree world famous Dune Drop down soft, white sand. It is about the equivalent of an 11-story building.From the top of the highest dune it is 450-feet down to Lake Michigan; however the place most people start their decline is at the 284-foot mark.There is a sign clearly stating the $3,000 fineif you run down to the bottom and need to be rescued to get back up.
